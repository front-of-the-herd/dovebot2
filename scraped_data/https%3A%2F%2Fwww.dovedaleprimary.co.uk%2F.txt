'Imagine, Believe, Achieve'
Welcome to our school!
It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to Dovedale Primary School.  Our school has an excellent reputation in Liverpool and is highly respected within the local community. We have incredibly happy children, dedicated staff who provide a creative curriculum which is exciting and fun that is enriched through first hand experiences. We are very well supported by our parents, governors, PTA and other members of the local community.
We had an Ofsted inspection in March 2024 and are thrilled with the report, it can be found under the 'key information' tab.
In January 2024 we were very proud to be awarded The Rainbow Flag Award. It is a national quality assurance framework for all schools and youth-centred organisations. The award focuses on positive LGBT+, inclusion and visibility.
I hope that you enjoy looking at our website and find it both interesting and informative.
I look forward to welcoming you to our school in the future.
Mr Nik Smith
