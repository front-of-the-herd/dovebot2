4T Rules! (Pun intended)
Date:
7th Sep 2015 @ 7:34pm
Our first day in 4T.
4T came up with their own class rules on their first day. I was so impressed with how the class worked together to come up with a set of rules that everybody was happy with.
I think these rules will enable us all to get the best out of our time in 4T. I especially like the rule...
"We will have fun!"
Great work 4T!
