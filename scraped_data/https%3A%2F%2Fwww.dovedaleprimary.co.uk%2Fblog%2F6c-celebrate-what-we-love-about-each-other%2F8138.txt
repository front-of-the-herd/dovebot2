6C celebrate what we love about each other!

Hello people of Dovedale,
Today we did an activity to show the nice things we think about other people in our class. All you needed to do was stick a piece of paper on your back, then people would come and write lovely things about that person.  Everyone in our class are friends but this made us think diffrently about each other.  Nobody was left out (even Miss Cordon joined in) and everybody all had something on their back whether it was you're kind or you're my BFF. No matter what was on their back, it made people smile. This week was a test week so some people were stressed but I know that I don't want to leave Dovedale!  The point of this was to show us that we are more than SATs and thats our class motto. Today was a great day that eveyone enjoyed.
Thaks for reading...Lola
