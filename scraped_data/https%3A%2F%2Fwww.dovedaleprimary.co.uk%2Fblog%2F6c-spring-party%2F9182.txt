6C Spring party!
Date:
30th Mar 2016 @ 2:29pm
Today 6C celebrated earning 60 marbles over the last term for good behaviour.  So we had a MASSIVE PARTAAAAAY!
We had a competition to decorate the best table and the winners were: Thea, Tia, Lola, Sophie B, Sophie R and Emma!
We danced, sang, ate and played balloon volleyball! Fun was had by all (although Miss Cordon now needs a lie down!)
Happy Spring Break 6C!
