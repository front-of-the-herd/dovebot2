A message to Year 6...
Date:
6th May 2016 @ 3:06pm
To Year 6,
We are exceptionally proud of everything you have achieved over the last 9 months (and 7 years!)
This year has been the most difficult yet for year 6 children but you have given your all and we couldn't ask for any more.
Last tips for the weekend:
Early nights
Eat a good breakfast
Rest
There are many areas that SATs don't test; your artistic abilities, your athletic skills, the kind of person you are inside, how you treat others; all the things that make you, YOU!
As you are only 10 and 11, there are so many things that you are yet to discover about yourselves.  There is a long and exciting journey ahead of you, where you will learn what talents you have and where your place is in the world. Enjoy it!
You are all so much more than SATs - all the staff at Dovedale see this and we hope you do too!
Have a lovely, restful weekend and a big good luck for next week.
From: Miss Cordon, Mr Powell, Mr O'Toole, Mrs Cannon, Miss Edain, Mrs Boyce, Mrs Callister, Mrs Arends, Mrs Clark, Miss McGregor, Mr Kirkwood, Mr Smith and Nigel.
