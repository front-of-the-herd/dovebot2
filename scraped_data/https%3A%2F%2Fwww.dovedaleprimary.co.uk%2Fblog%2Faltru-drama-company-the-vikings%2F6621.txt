Altru Drama Company: The Vikings
Date:
1st Dec 2015 @ 12:15pm
Hello people of Dovedale,
This morning, we were very lucky to have Lisa from Altru Drama Company come in to work with us.  We did drama activities linked to the Vikings. We learnt about the Viking women and men and longboats.  I think we all learnt something new and it was very fun and interactive! Everyone joined in with the acting, singing and crazy actions (take a look at our photos and videos!)
Everybody feels very clever!
Thanks for reading,
Lola :)
