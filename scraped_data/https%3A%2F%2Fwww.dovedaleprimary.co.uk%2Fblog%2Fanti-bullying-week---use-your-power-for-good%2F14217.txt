Anti bullying week - use your Power for Good!
Date:
15th Nov 2016 @ 5:13pm
This week, 3DG have looked at ways we can use our Power for Good during this year's Anti Bullying week. We talked about how diverse we are, but that we are all good friends and kind to each other despite our differences. In discussion we came up with ideas about how we can help others, and looked at various scenarios where we could use our 'Power for Good'. We came up with solutions for each one. We also made posters to encourage people to be kind to one another, and see the opportunities presented in tricky situations.
3DG are a very kind class and good friends to each other - they came up with some fantastic ideas! Well done, I am very proud to teach such a lovely class!
Mrs Dunne.
