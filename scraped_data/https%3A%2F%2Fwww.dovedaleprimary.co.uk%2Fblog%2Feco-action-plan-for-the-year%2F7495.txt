ECO ACTION PLAN FOR THE YEAR
Date:
18th Jan 2016 @ 12:18pm
Hi! Farimah and Gabe here and we are going to talk about the  ECO ACTION PLAN!
We were considering some further steps in our eco school.  Miss Cordon asked us some questions...here are some of the questions she asked us and the answers we gave:
What could we do better?
Try and involve the infants more
Stop people vandalising the school plants
Use less paper for homework
Walk to school more
In what way is Dovedale School eco friendly?
We recycle
We water plants
We walk to school
We grow plants
We don't pollute the air
We don't litter
We save electricity
We have an eco team
We plan eco activities
What does eco mean to you?
Saving the planet
Trees
Gardening
Watering plants
Being green!
Recycling
We will use these ideas that the children came up with to make an eco action plan to plan our eco meetings for this term.  We hope you have enjoyed reading them,
Farimah and Gabe :-)
