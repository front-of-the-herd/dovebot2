English focus: Way Home by Libby Hathorn
Date:
18th Jan 2016 @ 9:40am
Over the last 2 weeks, Year 6 have been discussing what it would like to be homeless and living on the streets.
Children from all three classes have been taking part in debates, art activities and writing activities relating to the themes in 'Way Home', a wonderful picture book written by Libby Hathorn.
In Way Home, we follow Shane on his journey home where he encounters many challenges, including; a monster dog, a gang and the busy traffic.  Shane is mostly upbeat and positive, but also has moments when we see his vulnerability and loneliness, like when he adopts a street-cat for company.
The children jumped into this topic whole-heartedly and create some amazing pieces of work.  The teachers were particularly impressed with their ability to empathise with Shane.
Please enjoy the photographs from our amazing hot seating session Friday!
