Filming a Newsround episode: Interviewing a Syrian refugee
Date:
24th Feb 2016 @ 10:28am
Hello people of Dovedale,
Today we did some acting -  one of my personal favourites.We worked in groups of three: one person would be a presenter, another person would be the News reporter and the last person would be Manar, who is a Syrian refugee.  It was a great way to think about how reugees live everyone got a turn to show their performance.  And of course it wouldn't be 6C if there wasn't a bit of competition! We had three winners:
Ryan, Kirsten and Lola.
Thea, Khaleem and Khyro.
Lily, Emma and Alice.
I had an amazing time and I know everyone else did as well. We can't wait to lean more about the refugees later in the week.
Thanks for reading....Lola.
A shout out : Happy Birthday Lily!!!
