Isaaq's Adventures in Oz!
Date:
14th Jul 2016 @ 12:08pm
Hi, My name is Isaaq and I've been at Dovedale for 5 happy years.  I'm now moving to Australia permanently with my family and I'd love to keep in touch with my Dovedale friends and teachers! I will be updating my blog regularly from Australia and I hope you all comment and write back to me :-)
Enjoy year 5 4GD!
From Isaaq.
