Jeremy Kyle does Hamlet! 6C
Date:
17th Mar 2016 @ 10:31am
Hello people of Dovedale,
As you may know this week has been
Shakespeare week
we've been looking at plays like:Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and Macbeth. Hamlet was an interesting story with many relationships - one of which is Hamlet and Ophelia. Obviously Ophelia goes through a lot with Hamlet so we decided this needed sorting out...the
Jeremy Kyle
way.We worked in groups of three.
Miss Cordon laughed so much her cheeks hurt!
Bye for now, Lola :-)
