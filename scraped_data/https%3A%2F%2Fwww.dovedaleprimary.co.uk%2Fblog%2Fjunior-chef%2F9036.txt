Our Healthy Eating Recipe: Exotic Fruit Surprise!
Today the children joined Handa, a young Kenyan girl, as she made her journey to visit her friend Akeyo. On the way she collected delicious and tempting fruits.  The children learnt about a wide range of fruits as well as how to create their very own fruit surprise sundae. How yummy do they look!
What was your favourite part of the afternoon?
