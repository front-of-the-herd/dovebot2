Maths through football!
Date:
1st Feb 2016 @ 1:51pm
In Maths through football we made our very own dream teams and used all 4 operations to work out different sums about our football teams. Each team earned points for correct answers and good team work. Thank you Ben and Scott for a great morning!
Sam - "I really enjoyed today as my 2 favourite things were combined. I loved making my own dream team and dribbling the ball in the hall."
Ciaran - "I loved it! Football and maths together was really fun. The teachers were amazing."
Marie - "It was lovely to play football because I never really play it."
Maysaa - "First we did fun but hard maths and we got to pick our own dream teams. After that, we did lots of tecniques with a football."
Hannah - "Maths through football is really good because it is educational and fun."
Ollie - "I really liked it. Even though football is not my favourite hobby, it was still fun."
Taha - "It wasn't good, it was brilliant! It was so amazing to do 2 of my favourite things about school in one lesson."
Aladji - "I thought I was bad at football but I tried hard and I turned out to be good."
Emma - "We got to work in teams with our table groups. I like maths but I don't like football but I still really enjoyed it."
Harry - "It was great, I really enjoyed it. It was the perfect combination, football and maths!"
Finlay - "I liked being in goal today for my team in the football match. The maths was also quite fun too."
Evie - "I don't usually play football because I don't like but after today I think I quite enjoy it."
Amelia - "It was so cool to be doing the same thing in one lesson but I preferred the maths part."
Jamie - "It was really fun doing the maths and I really enjoyed the football part too."
Anika - "This morning was really fun because we worked on our tables and we played football in teams."
Maddie - "Even though it was football it was really fun because it was different to what I normally do."
Livia - "Being able to do maths and football was really cool. After today, I have definitely changed my mind about football."
Lilia - "It was a really good day doing maths and football mixed together, there was so many activities."
