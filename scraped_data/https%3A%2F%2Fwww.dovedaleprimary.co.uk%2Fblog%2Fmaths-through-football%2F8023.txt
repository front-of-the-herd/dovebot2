Maths through Football!
Date:
8th Feb 2016 @ 3:49pm
Hello people of Dovedale,
Today Years 5 and 6 got to do the maths through football. Everyone was very enthusiastic and interractive whitch made it ten times more fun.  I think it made a lot of people more excited about maths and learning which is a big positive!
The first thing we did was maths in class.  We worked in groups and had races to see who could get the correct anwers to the questions. Then we went to the hall to play some football. If there's something new that we've learnt today, It's that our class are not to sporty - we were panting after 1 minute!
Thanks for reading...Lola
