Our trip to the building site
Date:
9th Jun 2016 @ 3:06pm
4T, 4GD, 5M and 5B all visited the building site together today and found out lots of imformation about how the build is going and exactly what is being done. There was also a chance to learn about health and safety and find out about what different things are used or needed for.
Leave a comment below with a question you would like to ask the builders.
