We are the Reading Ambassadors for 4T.
Maia -
"In my opinion books are adventures that change the way we think of life and they help us to look at things from different perspectives. Every book should have the right to be read and open up its stories to the world. Reading can help to give you a future and can keep you going."
Taha - "Whenever I feel sad, reading makes me happy. Books are so interesting. They give you knowledge. I like reading out loud but I also like reading quietly. I also love tidying up the class library."
Livia - "I simply love absolutely anything to do with reading! I like reading to other people no matter what their age. I really dislike it when I see a book that has been torn. I love reading stories and then recommending them to other people. I like discussing them and sharing my opinion. I would like to help everyone to experience the amazing power of books."
Harry - "I respect every book in this school. I am really good at giving book reviews and I love reading aloud. I enjoy reading to other people and I try to make stories as interesting as possible."
Maddie - "I love reading both at home and in school. I really enjoy keeping our library neat and tidy and I am good at sorting books out. I like to recommend stories to other people and I enjoy talking about books with other children."
Leave a comment below and tell us about your favourite books or
favourite authors. Do you have any stories to recommend to us? Or
simply tell us why you love reading.
