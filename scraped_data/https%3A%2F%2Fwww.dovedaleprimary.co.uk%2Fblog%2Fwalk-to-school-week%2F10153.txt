Walk to School Week
Date:
13th May 2016 @ 11:06am
Walk to School Week
!
Walk to School Week will take place between the
16
th
- 20th May
.
Every day during that week, teachers will be giving out raffle tickets to children who have walked to school.  One child from each year group will win a voucher when we announce the winners in assembly.
Remember
, even if you have to drive, you can still take part by parking a few streets away from school and walking the rest of the way.  Walking to school helps the environment and keeps you healthy, so try to take part!
Good luck!!!
From The Eco Committee,
Sophie, Sienna, Aliyah, Ina, Gabe, Farimah, Ruth, Cerys, Zaenab, Lilia, Louis, Moneeb, Daniel.
