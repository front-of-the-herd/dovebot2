Water Polo runners-up.
Date:
7th Dec 2015 @ 6:46pm
Dovedale's year 5/6 Water Polo team were a credit to our school today.
They were entered into the deep water competition and had to play full matches without touching the floor - which required lots of stamina! Our defence held strong and the team work was magnificent. Matthew from 5B scored in every match and we were unfortunate not to progress to the final. Well done to you all - what a tough competition!
