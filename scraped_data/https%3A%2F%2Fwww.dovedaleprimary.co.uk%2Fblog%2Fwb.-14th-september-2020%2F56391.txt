18th Sep 2020 @ 8:07am
We have enjoyed a very busy week in Year 2 this week. We are so proud of how the children have returned to school and how maturely they are coping with all the changes. This week they have worked in their new Read, Write Inc groups.
This week we have been:
Maths -  Identifying and representing numbers to 100 and showing our understanding of place value by using part-part-whole models.
English - We finally read our new text The Night Gardener, it was a big hit with the children! We learnt about noun, adjectives and verbs and used these to write some poetry.
We alternate RE and Computing with PE and Handwriting, these lessons are taught bi-weekly.
RE -
Is it possible to be kind all of the time?
ICT - We used the programme Scratch Jr to investigate move commands and create a travel algorithm.
Science - Changing Materials, this week we have explored, the best fabric for making curtains, which material is most functional for making a boat and how different materials can be changed by bending, stretching, twisting, squashing.
Next week:
Maths - To explain tens and ones using addition and compare objects and numbers using inequality symbols.
English - We will explore using conjunctions, alliteration and exclamation marks in our writing.
RE -
Is it possible to be kind all of the time?
ICT - Using the programme Scratch Jr to investigate move commands and create a travel algorithm.
Science - Changing Materials - we will investigatre the effect of heat on certain materials.
Geography - We will consider our big question for this term, Is Liverpool a powerful city? We will look at the locality of Liverpool and identify where it is on a map of the UK.
Please continue logging on to Oxford Reading Buddy.
