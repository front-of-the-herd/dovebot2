Y6 Weekly blog 21st September
Date:
23rd Sep 2018 @ 8:59am
It was nice to see year 6 children showing off their classrooms to parents on Wednesday - there is already so much work displayed on the English working walls which reflected the level of description and vocabulary that went into Friday's poetry writing.
We now have SPAG.com up and running and all children have logins for homework. By  4.30 pm on Thursday,  12 children were already registered as having completed their homework - good start!
Remember:
Maths and spag homework goes out every Thursday to be completed by Monday,
Spellings will go out on a Monday to be returned for a Friday test,
Children need to read - if possible - every night and update their reading record as they go.
See you all on Monday for PE!
