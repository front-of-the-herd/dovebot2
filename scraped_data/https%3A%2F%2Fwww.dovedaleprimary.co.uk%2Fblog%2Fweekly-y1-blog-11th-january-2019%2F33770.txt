Happy New Year!
We hope you all had a lovely holiday.
This week we have been learning:
Maths – We counted on from 10. We quickly realised that counting on from 10 is a lot easier than counting on from other numbers. We then partitioned our second number using a part whole.
5+7= 12
5     2
10+2= 12
English - Introduced to The Great Explorer text. We predicted where Tom was going on his adventure using the word 'because'.
Big
Elephants
Can
Always
Understand
Small
Elephants
Science – Introduced our new topic ‘Materials’
History - We have started to look at a famous explorer.
Next week we will be:
Maths – Number bonds to 20 (
1+19, 2+18, 3+17, 4+16, 5+15  Etc. )
English – Our weekly focus words are:
Why, When, What
.
We will be writing a recount of Tom’s adventures focussing the suffix ‘ed’
Science – Looking at materials that are transparent, opaque and flexible.
History - We will be finding out more information about who this famous explorer is.
Please practise Week 1 spellings in the homework book and continue logging on to Mathletics.
Have a lovely weekend.
