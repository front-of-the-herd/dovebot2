Weekly Y1 Blog 14th September 2018
Date:
14th Sep 2018 @ 6:19pm
We have had a great week in Year1!
This week we have been learning:
Maths - We have started using the part-whole method. The children have been using this method for addition.
English - We have been exploring the book 'Traction Man'. We have labelled our own Traction Man, described Traction Man using the word 'and' in our sentences and created secret missions for Traction Man using adverbs.
Science - We focussed on the question 'Is everyone's body the same?' To answer this question we looked at hand size, foot size, height and eye colour. We then labelled our body and compared them.
History - We will be looking at life when our Grandparents were children this half term. To introduce this topic we looked at old and new toys and what school was like when our Grandparents were little. We thought of questions we would like to ask our Grandparents.
Computing - We started looking at algorithms this week. We had to create an algorithm and give it to our friend to follow.
In addition to this we have been counting forwards and backwards from a given number. We will continue to practise this.
Next week we will be:
Maths - Focussing on place value of teen numbers and above. We will be using the part-whole method to help us.
English - Continuing to explore ‘Traction Man’. Using capital letters, full stops and adverbs in our sentences.
Science - Exploring our sense of taste. We will be looking at ways we can describe what we taste.
Computing - Creating a word for our Beebot to travel around.
Have a wonderful weekend and do not forget to look over your spellings.
