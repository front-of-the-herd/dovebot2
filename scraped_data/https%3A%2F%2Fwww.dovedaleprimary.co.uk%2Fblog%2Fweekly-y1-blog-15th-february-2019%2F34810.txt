We want to congratulate our Year1 children on a fantastic half term.
This week has been another busy one for us!
Maths – We have been exploring place value of numbers up to 50 and finding one more and one less. We have been talking about how many tens and ones are in each number.
English -  Our weekly focus words are:
where, who, why
We have been using conjunctions to join sentences.
Science - We have been exploring which materials are suitable for a Polar Explorer.
After half term we are:
Maths – Continuing to look at place value.
English -  Writing a diary entry from the view of Robert Scott.
Science -  Exploring weather and creating our own weather report.
ICT - Making characters move on Scratch Jnr
RE - Discussing special visitors and how we welcome them.
During half term you have a Maths Project to complete.
