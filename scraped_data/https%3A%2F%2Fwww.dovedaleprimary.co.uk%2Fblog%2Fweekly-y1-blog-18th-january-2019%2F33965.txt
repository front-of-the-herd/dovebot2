We have had a busy week this week!
On Monday a hot air balloon crashed onto our playground. We think it belongs to Tom but we have yet to find him!
This week we have been learning:
Maths – different ways to make 20.
Have a look in your homework book to find our number bonds to 20 song.
English - We have been writing sentences using the suffix 'ed'
Science – We have been looking at the key vocabulary:
-Transparent
- Opaque
- Flexible
- Absorbent
History - We started to gather information about our explorer. We found out that our explorer is Captain Robert Falcon Scott
Next week we will be:
Maths – Recapping subtraction with 20.
English – Our weekly focus words are:
there, was, once
We will be innovating our own story about an exploration.
Science – Polar Fun Day
History - Finding out more information about Captain Scott expedition
Please practise Week 2 spellings in the homework book and continue logging on to Mathletics.
Have a lovely weekend.
