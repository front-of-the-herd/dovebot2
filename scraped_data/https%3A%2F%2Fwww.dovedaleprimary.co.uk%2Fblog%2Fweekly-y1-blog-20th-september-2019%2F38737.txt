Weekly Y1 Blog 20th September 2019
Date:
20th Sep 2019 @ 1:15pm
We have had another fantastic week in Year 1. This week we welcomed Perry's Roadshow into school. We had the opportunity to look at and touch a range of animals. We classified them based on the information Miss Morley gave us.
This week we have been:
Maths –  We have been comparing numbers using 'greater than and less than'. We introduced our inequality symbols (< = >)
English -  We introduced our new text. Traction Man is a real favourite of Mrs Dwan's so we have spent the week exploring the character and deciding what type of character we think Traction Man is.
Science – We have been classifying animals into Mammals, Reptiles, Fish,Birds, Amphibians, Insects.
Computing - We have exploring how to control a beebot by using only code.
Next week we will be:
Maths –  We will be continuing to compare numbers using our fab vocabulary.
Greatest
Smallest
More than
Less than
English -  We are focussing on using capital letters for the beginning of names. We will be continuing to use conjunctions in our writing.
Science - exploring senses
Homework this week - Children have weekly spellings and assigned Mathletics homework. Check the login details in their reading diaries.
Please continue logging on to Oxford Reading Buddy.
Have a lovely weekend!
