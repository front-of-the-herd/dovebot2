We have had an AMAZING week! Thank you so much for all the effort you put in to the wonderful World Book Day costumes.

English -  We have been using our inference skills and the contextual clues to predict what our story is going to be about.
Science -  We observed what happens to deciduous trees during different seasons. We also looked at Evergreen trees.
World Book Day - We had a fantastic day surrounded by lots of different books. Check our Twitter for all our fun activities.
The Year 1 staff are extremely proud of all our children this week. The behaviour whilst visiting the Library was impeccable. Please remember to return the books when you have finished.
