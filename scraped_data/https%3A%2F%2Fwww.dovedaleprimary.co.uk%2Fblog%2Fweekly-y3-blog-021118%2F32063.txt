Weekly Y3 Blog 02.11.18

This week in English, we have been focusing on the writing topic of stories with familiar settings. We have started looking at the book FLOTSAM which tells the story of a boy who finds a camera that has been washed up on the beach. The boy goes to develop the pictures and can’t believe what they reveal. Because this book has no words, we have been writing the introduction to the story where the boys finds the camera on the beach.
In Maths, we are continuing to focus on addition and subtraction involving money. Children have been converting £ to p and next week we will focus on calculating change. On Friday, we will be opening a shop in our classroom where children will be able to buy a range of items.
We have started our new Science topic this term which is forces and magnets. The first lesson involved children looking at the forces of push, pull and twist. Next lesson, we will plan an experiment to investigate how objects move on different surfaces.
Remembering World War One
Next week in school, we will be remembering WW1. Children will be making poppies which will form a display of remembrance. We need children to bring in plastic bottles to school next week to help us make the poppies.
Year 3 Nativity
Children will be bringing home the words to the songs in our naivety. We would greatly appreciate it if you could help your child practice these songs at home. The music can be found on Youtube.
Well done to our stars of the week this week. Pictures of those children are on our Twitter feed.
