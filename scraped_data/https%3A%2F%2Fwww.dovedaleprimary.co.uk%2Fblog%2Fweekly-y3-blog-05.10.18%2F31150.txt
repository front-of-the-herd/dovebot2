This week in English, we have celebrated National Poetry Day which was on Thursday 4
th
October. We have been focusing on shape poems which include a range of vocabulary that help bring a storm alive. Next week, we will be looking at haiku poems. We shall look forward to displaying these on our ‘Writer of the Week’ display.
This week in Maths, we have been focusing on word problems involving both column addition and subtraction involving exchanging. We also looked at a number of column addition and subtraction questions where mistakes were made. Children had to identify and explain the mistake and then correct it. Next week, we will continue to focus on column addition and subtraction within complex problem solving questions.
Last week in Science, we looked at different soil types and identified which soils allowed the most water to pass through. This week we have been collecting our findings and presenting these. Next week, we shall look at how different types of soil are formed.
On Friday 5th October, Year 3 enjoyed a History Day linked to The Stone Age. We had four different activities set up which will included: Stone Age Food, Stone Age weapons, the story of Stone Henge and Stone Age challenge questions. Each class moved around the four different activities throughout the day to gain a better understanding of the Stone Age. Check out our pictures on Twitter.
Well done to our stars of the week this week, all chosen for handwriting and presentation! Pictures of those children are on our Twitter feed.
