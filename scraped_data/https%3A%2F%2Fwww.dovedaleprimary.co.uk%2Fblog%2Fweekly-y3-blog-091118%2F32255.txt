Maths
We have been focusing on adding and subtracting money this week. We have converted £ and p and made different amounts of money using a range of different coins. We have also been focusing on working out the change from £10 and £5. Next week, we will start our multiplication and division unit.
English
We have continued working on FLOTSAM this week and children have produced some fantastic writing! We took a closer look at the pictures that were taken underwater and we have seen the interesting and unusual things fish actually get up to. Children wrote a descriptive piece of writing about one of the pictures where an octopus was reading to his children while piranhas watched with great interest.
Remembering World War One
This week, we have been remembering WW1. Children made poppies which will form a display of remembrance. Take a look at our Year 3 Twitter page to see the poppies children made.
Year 3 Nativity
Children have brought home the script and songs to our naivety. We would greatly appreciate it if you could help your child practice the words to their parts and songs at home. The music can be found on Youtube.

Well done to our stars of the week this week. Pictures of those children are on our Twitter feed.
