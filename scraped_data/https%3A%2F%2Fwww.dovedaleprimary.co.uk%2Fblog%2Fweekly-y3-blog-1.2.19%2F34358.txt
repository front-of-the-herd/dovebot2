Weekly Y3 Blog 1.2.19
Date:
1st Feb 2019 @ 1:06pm
English - We have had another fantastic week in English. Last week, we focused on the fight scene between Theseus and the Minotaur and this week we have been writing about Theseus escaping from the Labyrinth. Next week, we shall listen to the final part of the myth and we shall discover what happens to Theseus and Ariadne.
Maths - We have been focusing on very challenging division word problems. Next week, we shall continue our work on word problems and shall move onto solving missing number division problems.
Science - We had a practical filled lesson in Science this week. In Year 2, children discovered that plants need light and water to grow so this week we set up our investigation to see if plants need air and soil to grow. We also looked at the different parts of plants by cutting up flowers to discover what was inside.
History - We focused on the importance of the Beaker people and their impact on Britain. Next week, we shall look at a range of different round houses to discover how people use to live during the Bronze/Iron Age.
P.E. - Children enjoyed another lesson focusing on dance. Children are starting to put together a range of different performances. Check out our Twitter feed to see some videos.
Computing - We are focusing on programming this half term in Computing. Children have been using scratch to make a number of algorithms to control a character.
