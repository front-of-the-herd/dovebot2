Happy New Year from Year 3
We hope all year 3 children and their families had a wonderful and restful Christmas break. It is fantastic to be back and we are looking forward to this important Spring Term.
What’s happening this half term
Maths
— Every 2 weeks, children will further consolidate their understanding of number and place value through an arithmetic test.
We shall continue our work on multiplication and then move onto division. After the February half term, we shall focus on fractions.
Writing
—We shall be starting our new topic of myths this term. We will be using the myth Theseus and the Minotaur as our main focus text within our English lessons. We shall continue to work towards a Friday writing task each week based around our focus text.  End of Year Writing Expectations can be found on our Year 3 page. These are also accessible around the classroom, in their writer’s toolkits and always through the tasks we deliver.
T
exts to look forward to are: Theseus and the Minotaur, Web Wabbit and The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs.
Science
— Our science topic is plants. Pupils will learn the key vocabulary linked to the topic and investigate the way in which water is transported within plants and explore the part that flowers play in the life cycle of flowering plants, including pollination, seed formation and seed dispersal. Children will also identify and describe the functions of different parts of flowering plants: roots, stem/trunk, leaves and flowers.
History—
Our new history topic is The Bronze Age. Children will learn about chronological understanding by looking at timelines from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age. Children will also look at Bronze Age roundhouses and Bronze Age burial rituals. Children will also write about a day in the life of a Bronze Age person as a form of cross curricular writing. Finally, children will look at the significance of Stonehenge and describe the main changes in Britain from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age.
