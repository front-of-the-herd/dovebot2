Weekly Y3 Blog 12.10.18

This week in English, we have been continuing our poetry unit. After finishing our shape poems, we started to look at haiku poems. We started by reading a range of different haiku poems and placing them on a value line. Today, we have created a bank of vocabulary we can use to help us write our haiku poems next week.
This week in Maths, we have continued to focus on word problems involving both column addition and subtraction involving exchanging.  We have looked at complex problems where children had to decide what operation to use in order to solve the problem. Next week, we shall look at using the inverse operation in order to solve missing number questions.  For example  ?  + 343 = 546
In Science this week and next week, we will focus on how soil is formed. Roger Rock and Simon Soil will help us tell the story of how soil is formed. I’m sure children would love to retell the story at home.
Black History Week
Next week, we will be looking the story of Rosa Parks and how her actions changed the world. We will link this into our English by writing a diary entry from the perspective of Rosa Parks of when she refused to move seats on a bus in America.
Well done to our stars of the week this week. Pictures of those children are on our Twitter feed.
