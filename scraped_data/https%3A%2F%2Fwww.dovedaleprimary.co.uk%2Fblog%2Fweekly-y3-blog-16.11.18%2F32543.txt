Maths
This week in Maths, we have started our new maths unit of multiplication and division. We first looked at showing our understanding of multiplication by using a range of resources to help us represent different multiplication questions. We then moved on to using the bar model to help us find fact families followed by looking at factors of numbers.
Next week, we will start to use column multiplication using Base 10, place values counters and calculation mats to help us set this out. Once we have done this both visually and practically, we shall start to move onto using column multiplication to multiply at 2 digit number by a 1 digit number without exchanging and then multiplying a 2 digit number by a 1 digit number involving exchanging within word problems.
English
We have once again continued working on FLOTSAM this week and have reached the end of the book. Children enjoyed discovering the pictures the camera took underwater to see how the animals truly behaviour. The story ended by the boy throwing the camera into the ocean, like a message in a bottle, waiting for someone else to find it. To accompany the camera, children have started to write a letter to inform the person who finds it about themselves.
Science
We have planned our own Science experiment to investigate how different surfaces effect how an object moves. Y3K and Y3SL are going to investigate if the change of material effects the speed of a car going down a ramp. Y3B and Y3S will investigate how the different surfaces effect objects moving but will focus on does the changing of material effect how far a car travels in distance off a ramp. Next week, we will conduct the experiment and compare our results across Y3.
Year 3 Nativity
We are continuing to practice for our nativity. We would greatly appreciate it if you could help your child practice the words to their parts and songs at home. The music can be found on Youtube.
