Weekly Y3 Blog 21.9.18

We have had a great week in Year 3!
The children have been focusing on 'The Stone Age Boy' in our English lessons which is our focus text. We have been writing from the perspective of the main character who has been transported back in time to the Stone Age. Fabulous writing has been produced in all Year 3 classes this week!
We have also been looking at ambitious vocabulary and adding words to our ‘Words of the Week’ display.
Maths has involved lots of place value and number line work which has been very successful. Next week, we shall start to look at addition and subtraction.
Our Science topic for this term is 'Rocks.' We have conducted a rock experiment to assess the durability and permeability of certain rocks. Next week, will be looking at different soil types in order to identify which soil allows the most water to pass through.
Our History topic this half term is The Stone Age. Last week, all Y3 children took part in a Stone Age workshop where they found out what life was really like for someone living in the Stone Age. This week we compared life in the Stone Age to life in 2018.
