Maths
This week in Maths, we started to use column multiplication to multiply a 2 digit number by a 1 digit number. We first used Base 10, place values counters and calculation mats to help us set this out. Once we had done this both visually and practically, we started to move onto using column multiplication to multiply at 2 digit number by a 1 digit number without exchanging and then multiplying a 2 digit number by a 1 digit number involving exchanging within word problems. Next week, we shall continue to use column multiplication within a word problems.
Maths Workshop
Children will take part in a Tax Workshop next week where they will find out how tax works and the unusual things people used to be taxed for.
Maths Home Activity Pack
Children will bring home a maths activity book which contains fun and practical games for the children to play. Within the pack, is a letter explaining how often we would like children to play these games.
English
We have finished working on FLOTSAM this week. To accompany the camera which was thrown into the water, children have written a letter to inform the person who finds it about themselves. We shall now move onto our new writing topic of information texts. We shall start by looking at the features of these and by the end of next week, children will have written an information paragraph about Liverpool.
Science
We carried out our own Science experiments this week to investigate how different surfaces effect how an object moves. We discovered that the smoother the surface the faster and further the car will travel as this type of surface causes the least amount of friction.
Year 3 Nativity
We are continuing to practice for our nativity. We would greatly appreciate it if you could help your child practice the words to their parts and songs at home. The music can be found on Youtube.
