We spent our final week on 'The Stone Age Boy' in our English lessons which has been our focus text. This week, we have been writing a diary entry from the perspective of Om. From next week in Year 3, we will be picking a Writer of the Week from each class. The Writer of the Week will have their work displayed on our new writing display to showcase their fabulous work.
Maths has involved lots work on addition and subtraction. We have been using the bar model to find fact families and started to use column addition and subtraction. Next week, we will be using column addition and subtraction involving exchanging to solve word problems.
Our Science topic for this term is 'Rocks.' This week, we have been looking at different soil types in order to identify which soil allows the most water to pass through. Next week, we are going to be looking at how soil is formed.
On Friday 5th October, we will be having a History Day in Year 3. We will have four different activities set up which will include: Stone Age Food, Stone Age weapons, the story of Stone Henge and Stone Age challenge questions. Each class will move around the four different activities throughout the day to gain a better understanding of the Stone Age.
