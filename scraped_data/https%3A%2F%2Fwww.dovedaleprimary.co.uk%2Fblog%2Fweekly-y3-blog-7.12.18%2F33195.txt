Year 3 Nativity
Y3S and Y3SL performed their nativity on Thursday and Y3B and Y3K performed their nativity today. We are all so proud of all our children for putting on a fantastic show! Thank you for all the support from parents for helping to practice both the dances and songs at home. Well done Y3!
Art Week
This week, we have focused on creating Stone Age art work using a range of different materials. Children have created both individual and collaborative pieces of work that we will display during our Art Exhibition. Check out our Twitter page to see what we have been up to this week.
Year 3 Art Exhibition
On Monday 17
th
December, Year 3 will be hosting an art exhibition to show case the work children will have produced during our Art Week.
The art exhibition will be held in the Year 3 classrooms and will start straight after school and will last until 4:15pm.
We will ask people who visit our exhibition to leave an anonymous comments about our art so we can then use this when evaluating it.
Year 3 D.T Week
Next week, we will be starting our D.T week where children will plan, make and evaluate felt decorations. After evaluating  a range of different felt decorations and practicing a running, blanket and cross stitch, we will design and make our own felt decoration.
