We have had a great start to Year 4!
The children turned into 'The Borrowers' in our English lessons which is our focus text and we have had some fabulous writing produced! We have been looking at ambitious vocabulary and getting to grips with the new Year 4 writing tool kits.
Maths has involved lots of place value work and we have been using the more than and less than symbols to compare numbers up to 5 digits.
Our Science topic for this term is 'Sound.' We went on a sound hunt around our school to record all of the sounds we could hear. Our Art lessons are linked to our Science topic and we have been looking at paintings by the artist Kandinksy, who was inspired by music when he painted.
Follow us on Twitter for daily updates! @DovedaleY4
Have a lovely weekend.
YEAR 4 TEAM.
