In our Maths lessons this week we have been doing lots of work using the bar model! We have had to use our knowledge of the inverse to solve tricky problems. We are going to be doing lots of work on subtraction with exchanging next week...
In English we have started our new topic of 'newspapers' and we have been learning about the features.  The children have been writing about how the new Doctor from Doctor Who is a female. They all thought of their own catchy headlines. Have a look on our Twitter feed for daily updates!
In our History lesson we were using artefacts to see if we could find out about Ancient Greece. The artefacts we were looking at were pots and vases and we had to work together in our teams to put all of the broken pieces back together! It was really challenging but we got there in the end! Our Art lesson on Friday involved looking at the work of Kandinsky to inspire us to create our own abstract pieces of Art. The children all really enjoyed it.
It has been a great first week back, well done to everybody for your continued hard work!
Have a lovely weekend! Stay safe if you are going to be around fireworks.
What is a firework's favourite food?
Bangers and mash!
