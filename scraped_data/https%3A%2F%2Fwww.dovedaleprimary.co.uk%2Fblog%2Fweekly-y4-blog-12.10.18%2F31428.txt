In our Maths lessons this week we have been looking at column addition. Lots of the children are very confident with column addition so we are looking forward to starting column subtraction next week! Mathletics is now up and running, every child should now have their log in - if anybody has lost it we can print it out again for you. We will use Mathletics weekly as extra homework and it will always link to what we have been doing in school that week.
In our English lessons we have been writing letters to Jean Luc Courcoult, the inventor of the Giants that came to Liverpool last weekend! We think the children may have just persuaded him to return again... just one last time!
Our Harvest assembly is next Wednesday so we have spent time this week rehearsing it - the children have all done so well learning their lines and the songs lyrics, we look forward to performing for you all next week. :-)
Our spellings next week will be the half term statutory spellings which the children have been practising in school. The words are:
often, opposite, ordinary, particular, peculiar, perhaps, popular and posi
tion.
Next week is Black History Week and the children are going to be learning all about the Windrush Generation.
Well done to our stars of the week this week, photographs of those children are on our Twitter feed, @DovedaleY4.
Have a lovely weekend!
YEAR 4 TEAM.
