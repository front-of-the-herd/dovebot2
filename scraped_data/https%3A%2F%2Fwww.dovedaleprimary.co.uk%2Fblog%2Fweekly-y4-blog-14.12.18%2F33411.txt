A lovely week in Year 4!
We have had a few assessments this week and the children have all worked extremely hard. Well done Year 4! Mathletics homework has been set and there are quite a few activities on there to keep the children going until January! We have been practising our times tables every single day and have been working on our rapid recall, especially with the 7 x tables.
In Science, we have continued to study living things. The children have been identifying and classifying different types of vertebrates and grouping them accordingly. We have also been finding out similarities and differences between the different groups.
It has been D.T week this week and the children have been working on making a product that uses a wheel mechanism. We won’t give too much away as the children will be bringing them home next week!

It has been a lovely week and the children have all shown so much creativity and enthusiasm in our afternoon lessons.
It is Christmas dinner day next Wednesday! The children can also wear their Christmas jumper. :-)
Have a lovely weekend and see you all on Monday for our final week of the Autumn term! Time flies when you're having fun!
YEAR 4 TEAM.
