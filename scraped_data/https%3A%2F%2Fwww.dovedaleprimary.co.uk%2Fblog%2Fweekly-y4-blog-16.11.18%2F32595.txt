This week was
ANTI-BULLYING
week and the theme was
RESPECT.
The children have been learning about all of the different kinds of bullying and have had lots of discussions. On Friday afternoon, the children watched an animation called
THE DAISY CHAIN
and then made their own daisies to share positive messages. Pictures are on our Twitter feed, @DovedaleY4. We will be putting our daisies up on display for everybody to see and to hopefully spread kindess.
In Maths and English this week we have been working very hard! In Maths, we have been working on our reasoning skills and we have been solving lots of tricky problems to do with rounding, estimating and finding the inverse. In English, the children have been learning how to take notes and are now familiar with acronyms and abbreviations.
We completed a mini Science assessment this week as we have finished our first topic of 'Sound.' The children should now be able to:
-Identify how sounds are made, associating some of them with something vibrating.
- Recognise that vibrations from sounds travel through a medium to the ear.
- Find patterns between the pitch of a sound and features of the object that produced it.
- Find patterns between the volume of a sound and the strength of the vibrations that produced it.
- Recognise that sounds get fainter as the distance from the sound source increases.
Well done to all of our stars of the week this week, thank you for your continued hard work.
Have a great weekend...
YEAR 4 TEAM.
