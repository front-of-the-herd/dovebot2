We can’t believe we’re already 2 weeks into our Spring term! This week has been another busy week and the children have been doing lots of learning!
In maths we have been doing lots of work around multiplying and dividing. The children are constantly improving their reasoning skills. Keep it up Year 4!
In our English lessons this week we have continued looking at stories from other cultures. The children have been concentrating on their descriptions, ambitious vocabulary and their use of ‘show, don’t tell’ in their writing. Us teachers are noticing that many children are enhancing their own vocabulary because of how much they’re reading, both at home in school! We are encouraging all children to always make sure that their reading books are challenging.
Our new Science topic of ‘Animals Including Humans’ got off to a great start this week as the children ordered the parts of the digestive system. We found out the name of different organs and researched their functions. Check out our Twitter feed for photographs! In our History lessons we are continuing to learn about the Romans. This week, the children found out about why the Romans decided to invade Britain. We are all very impressed with the children’s prior knowledge on this topic! 4BN enjoyed their sculpture day this week with Becky. All of the children’s work will be going up on display... watch this space!
As of next week, Mrs Mitchell will be flying solo in 4T as Miss Turner starts her maternity leave! (I’d like to say a special thank you to everybody for all of your kindness. I have had a fantastic time with my class and I will miss them all very much!)
Thank you for your continued support. Please continue to listen to your child read at home and practise times tables!
