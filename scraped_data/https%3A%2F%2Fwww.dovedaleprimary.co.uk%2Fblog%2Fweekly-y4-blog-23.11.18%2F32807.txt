A great week in Year 4 this week!
On Thursday, we had visitors from
HMRC
come in and present to us a Tax Workshop! The children found out all about taxes… have a look at the video below!
In our maths lessons this week, we have been learning all about
perimeter
. The children should all be familiar with how to find the perimeter of a 2D shape. There is a website attached below to help with perimeter. We went on to trying to solve tricky reasoning problems to do with perimeter, there is one at the bottom of this blog - see if you can have a go! So far, about 6 children across the year group have managed to solve the Greater Depth problem. We will be continuing working on perimeter next week. Our times tables focus this week has been our 7 x tables. The children have been practising every day, please keep practising whenever you can at home – we are working on our rapid recall in a mixed order.
Mathletics
homework should all be set up for the children, linking to what they’ve been doing this week.
Our English lessons this week built up to writing a non-chronological report. We watched a short documentary by David Attenborough talking about the Sahara desert and the children practised their note taking skills, concentrating on key vocabulary and facts. On Friday, they each produced a non-chronological report using the vocabulary and facts they had learned in the week – us teachers were very impressed with the end results. Well done to all children! Super writing.
J
Next week, we will start our new topic of ‘explanations.’
Well done to all of our
stars of the week
, your certificates are all very well deserved! Keep checking our Twitter for daily updates.
@DovedaleY4.
Have a lovely weekend.
YEAR 4 TEAM.
Have a look at this link to help with perimeter!
