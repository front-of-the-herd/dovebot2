World War One Poetry
Date:
24th Nov 2015 @ 3:43pm
Hi people of Dovedale,
So recently we have been doing WW1 work and today we wrote poems inspired by Wilfred Owen. We worked in groups of two and three and everyone had great fun. We all got to read them out and each and every one was different in it's own way.
World War One was tragic and it's made me and the rest of the class think diffrently about the past!!
Thank you for reading that's it from Lola and Luke, bye!
