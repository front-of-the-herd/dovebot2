We have had a great week in Year1!
This week we have been learning:
Maths - We have been looking at tens and ones in 2-digit numbers
English - We have continued to explore the book 'Traction Man'. We have been focussing on capital letters, full stops and finger spaces. We have also continued to use adverbs in our writing.
Science - We explored our sense of taste.
Computing - We created a world for our Beebot to travel around next week.
In addition to this we have been continuing to count forwards and backwards from a given number. We will continue to practise this.
Next week we will be:
Maths - We will start using Base-10 to look at place value of teen numbers and above. We will also explore the vocabulary of greater than and less than.
English - Continuing to explore ‘Traction Man’. Using capital letters, full stops and adverbs in our sentences.
Science - Exploring our sense of hearing.
Computing - Creating algorithms for our Beebot.
History - We are looking forward to welcoming our Grandparents in to school.
Have a wonderful weekend and do not forget to look over your spellings.
