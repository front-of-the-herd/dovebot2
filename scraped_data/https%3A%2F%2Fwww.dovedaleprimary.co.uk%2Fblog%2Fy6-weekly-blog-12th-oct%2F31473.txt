Year 6 children completed a water safety course this afternoon and displayed fantastic stamina whilst treading water in their pyjamas. Great Dovedale spirit and attitude!
On Tuesday, we were treated to a workshop from Parliamentary Education where we turned the junior hall into the House of Commons, debating topical issues to do with social media and the environment. Our excellent debating skills made the event really engaging and we can now conclude that our country would be better run by 11 year olds.
In maths, we have been working on the chunking method for long division this week. It's been fun! A bit more practise for homework and we'll all be chunking champions by Christmas.
Final week for autobiographies and children wrote newspaper reports this morning using writing features and journalistic writing style. Children are building sentences really well and focusing on using punctuation to enhance meaning as well as vocabulary that has an impact on the reader. Great work, year 6!
In history we looked at Maya life and decided whether certain events were cultural, political, social, religious or technological - and compared these events to our own local moment in history - Liverpool's giants.
