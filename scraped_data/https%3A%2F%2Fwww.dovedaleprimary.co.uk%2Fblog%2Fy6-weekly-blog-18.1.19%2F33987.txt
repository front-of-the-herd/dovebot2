Y6 Weekly Blog 18.1.19
Date:
18th Jan 2019 @ 4:55pm
What a busy week it was again. Already two weeks into Spring 1, and plenty to keep the year 6 teamÂ occupied.
Our new topics have started for Science (Light) and History (Crime and Punishment), and we have been trying to discover a wayÂ to answer the question, DoesÂ light travel in straight lines? Using torches in dark rooms, children managed to set up an enquiry, using light sources and sequencing small holes together to emit rays through onto a target.
Our history enquiry this week was to investigateÂ the impact that the Magna Carta has had on todayâ€™s society. After studying King John and the rebel barons, we later discovered the influence of the Magna Carta, not just in ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Britain, but in so many of todayâ€™s civilised societies worldwide. Our major discoveryÂ was the implications of the legal changes that took place and have lasted to today - so much better than the medieval systems we learned about last week! Â Impressive knowledge from some of our year 6 children so early in the topic.
In maths we have refined some of our arithmetic skills for division and appplied the method of finding decimal remainders in division to more complex reasoning problems. We have also been investigating parallel and perpendicular lines, identifying, classifying and creating them in shapes for our Geometry lesson.
We completed our writing topic today -Â following the textÂ Way Home -Â with an informal letter from the homeless boy in the story,Â to his parents. We were impressed by the personification of the city, the description of daily life and living inÂ a shelter, and Shaneâ€™s relationship with his new-found friend, a street-cat he can identify with called no-name.
Homework must be completed as always. ThereÂ is SPAG.com, maths in books, spellings and reading a minimum of 3 times per week to someone at home, recording in reading records.
The year 6 team.
