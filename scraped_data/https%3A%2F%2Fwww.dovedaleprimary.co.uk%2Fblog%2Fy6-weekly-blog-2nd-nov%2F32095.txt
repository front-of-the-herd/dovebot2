Y6 Weekly blog 2nd Nov
Date:
4th Nov 2018 @ 7:07pm
It's been great for the year 6 team to get back into the swing of things after half term and we've enjoyed seeing the fantastic progress our children are continuing to make.
In maths, arithmetic skills are improving all the time and we recommend children keep their skills sharp by practising quick recall of times tables at home as often as possible. Hit the Button is a great website for working  on mixed or individual times tables because children can work to beat their fastest score. In class, some children have been demonstrating their Hit the Button super speed on the big screen and challenging their teacher!
In English lessons, we read the story, The Matchbox Diaries and children made predictions about the genre, setting and characters when they each opened their own matchbox to find unusual items, such as olive stones, buttons and sunflower seeds. This all built up to Friday's letter writing when children wrote a persuasive letter from Italy to New York in 1916. Super results again for year 6.
Unfortunately, Garston baths had a break-in on Thursday night and swimming was cancelled but we hope to be back in business next week.
Finally, good luck to our athletics team this week for the big competition! We've got a good feeling about this year!
