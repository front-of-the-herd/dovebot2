Y6 Weekly blog 5th Oct
Date:
7th Oct 2018 @ 9:04pm
Thank you for your participation if you manged to make the SATs meeting this week. We hope you found it useful - we are always available for further discussions regarding SATs or any other matter.
Some of our year 6 children's best writing was delivered this Friday morning, continuing a week long study on Anne Frank, her family and their life in hiding. Parent's evening will be taking place just after half term - look out for this piece in you child's writing book, parents.
Following on from our history work on the Maya, children have started to develop ideas in their sketchbooks for Maya patterns and designs to help improve skills, leading up to painting and printing later in the topic. We would like children to research more ideas and even print samples of work or bring swabs of material in to help develop their ideas further.
Homework is increasingly important for children in year 6 and we are making sure the work we set is a reflection of the lessons taught that week. Please continue to work with your child on this and listen to them read as often as possible.
Many thanks
Year 6 Team
