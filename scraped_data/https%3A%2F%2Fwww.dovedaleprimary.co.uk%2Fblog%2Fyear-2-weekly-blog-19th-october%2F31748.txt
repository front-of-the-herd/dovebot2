Year 2 Weekly Blog 19th October
Date:
19th Oct 2018 @ 4:16pm
Well we've made it to the end of our first half term. The children have made a fantastic start to the year and have already made a huge amount of progress.
This week we have produced some wonderful writing both in our English lessons and in history. In English we retold the story of Peace at Last and in history we wrote a diary entry from the perspective of a civilian during World War Two. We have used our knowledge of number bonds to ten to support us with bonds to 100 and we have been noticing patterns when adding and subtracting. We we have carried out an investigation in science to find the best fabric to be used for curtains, exploring which fabric was the most opaque.
After half term we will be writing some descriptive Autumn poems. If you are out and about over half term please collect autumnal items such as different coloured and shaped leaves, conkers, acorns etc which we can use to aid our descriptions. In maths the children will be introduced to column addition and subtraction, first with multiples of ten and then any two 2 digit numbers. Our history topic is 'Fire Fire' and we will learn about Guy Fawkes and the gunpowder plot and the Great Fire of London.
Wishing you all a lovely half term!
