Year 2 weekly Blog 28th September
Date:
28th Sep 2018 @ 4:23pm
It's been another busy but successful week in Year two!
We have thoroughly enjoyed reading the story of Dogger in our English lessons and we wrote some brilliant descriptions of our own favourite soft toys in the style of Shirley Hughes. The children used some super adjectives and expanded noun phrases in their work.
In maths we have been using < > and = to compare and order numbers using our knowledge of place value to help us.
Next week we will become story writers and will plan, write and edit stories about our favourite soft toy. We will have a particular focus on using conjunctions to join clauses including words such as 'and' 'so' 'but and 'because.' In Maths we will move on to addition and subtraction within 20 and explore inverse relationships and fact families. We will continue our history topic about WWII including learning a popular wartime dance - the Lindyhop.
Thank you to all the children who have brought in any magazines and comics which they have finished reading at home. We are really grateful for the donations!
