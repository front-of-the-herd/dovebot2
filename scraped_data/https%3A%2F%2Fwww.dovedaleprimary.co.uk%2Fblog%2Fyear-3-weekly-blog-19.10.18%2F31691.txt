Black History Week
This week, we have been looking at the story of Rosa Parks and how her actions changed the world. We have linked this into our English by writing a diary entry from the perspective of Rosa Parks of when she refused to move seats on a bus in America.
Worth a Watch
Dr Who on Sunday 21st October at 18:55 on BBC One will be encountering Rosa Parks. They begin to wonder whether someone is attempting to change history.
What’s coming up next term?
English – Stories with familiar settings
Maths – Continuing addition and subtraction and then moving onto multiplication and division
Science – Forces and Magnets
Geography – Can the Earth shake rattle and roll?
Art – Stone Age cave paintings
D.T - Textiles (felt decorations)
PSHE – Getting on and falling out
R.E – Christianity and Christmas
French – Jeux et chansons (Games and song)
Well done to our stars of the week this week. Pictures of those children are on our Twitter feed.
Have a great half term!
