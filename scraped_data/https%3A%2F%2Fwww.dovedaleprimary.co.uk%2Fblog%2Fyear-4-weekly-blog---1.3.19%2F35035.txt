After a lovely half term break, we have been working hard again in Year 4:
We have been completing some assessments and had a fantastic time visiting Chester as part of our History topic:

English –Cold write linked to the Romans.
History – School trip to Chester
Science – Introducing States of Matter.
PE – Dance
French –Learning simple phrases you could use on holiday in France.
Music and ICT
Next week is going to be a very quiet week in Year 4, as many children will be taking part in PGL. However we will still be continuing our lessons until then.
English – Writing a Haiku poem.
Maths – Revisiting what we have learnt so far about fractions.
History – Recalling our amazing trip to Chester and what we have learned.
PE – Dance
Music and ICT
If you are not going to PGL Mrs Mitchell has got some exciting activities planned including massage with Mrs Norfolk, board games, art work and PE games with Mr Kirkwood.
Don’t forget World Book day on Thursday 7

Have a great weekend, The Year 4 Team
