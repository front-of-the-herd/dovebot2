Date:
8th Feb 2019 @ 1:55pm
It’s been a busy week once again in Year 4, we enjoyed our Rainbow Smiles workshop and learnt about how everyone is different, but how we can all live together in harmony:
Maths – our focus this week was factors of numbers as well as how to calculate the area of a variety of shapes.
English –Would you like to join the Roman army? We created our own recruitment poster.
History –Timelines – We looked at Roman events on the timeline and created our own.
Science – We investigated different food chains and looked at consumers, predators, prey and producers.
PE – Fitness
French – We continued simple conversations and introduced hobbies.
Music and ICT
Next week is our last week before half term and we are as busy as ever:
Maths –finding out about fractions.
English – Information texts – completing a job application to be a Roman soldier.
History – The Roman Army
Science –Finding out more about food chains.
PE – Fitness
