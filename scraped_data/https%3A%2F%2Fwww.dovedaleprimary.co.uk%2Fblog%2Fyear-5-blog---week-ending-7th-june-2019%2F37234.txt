A huge thank you for your continuing support.
Please ensure that you listen to your child read at least 3 times a week.
Please make sure that your child brings in their reading book and record card every day.
Remember to use your Mathletics account and have fun with maths!!!
Try out our new app to help you with your Times Tables! Awake that inner rock god!
For any children who want an extra challenge at home, why not have a go at ‘Hit the Button’.
We are looking for any parent who would be willing to come in to their child’s class and talk about job and the maths involved in it. If you would like to volunteer, please leave your details at the office or a note to your child’s teacher and we’ll be in touch.
Kind regards
