Year 5 weekly blog. 5-10-18
Date:
5th Oct 2018 @ 2:44pm
This week in Year 5, we have been working extremely hard and enjoying the following activities: -
Maths – Roman numerals.
English – The Princess’ Blankets by Carol Ann Duffy.
PHSE – Designing Bully Buster posters.
History - Sutton Hoo. Using evidence to solve the mystery.
Jigsaw – looking at rights, responsibilities, rewards and consequences.
P.E - developing athletics skills
Again, another amazing week we have had. We were extremely impressed with the children’s work, especially their work on Roman numerals. The speeches for school councillors were excellent! It can be quite daunting talking in front of your peers. Well done to everyone who took part. We cannot wait until next week where we will be enjoying the following lessons: -
Maths – Negative numbers.
English – Continuing work on The Princess’ Blankets by Carol Ann Duffy, culminating in describing their very own blanket suitable for the Princess.
Art – Critiquing Peter Thorpe’s art work, using artistic vocabulary.
History – Pagan beliefs and Early Christianity (internet research)
Science – What is a day? Investigation.
P.E - developing athletics skills
French – Healthy eating. Sandwich fillings
A huge thank you for your continuing support. Enjoy your weekend.
Enjoy the giants!
Can you ensure that you listen to your child read at least 3 times a week.
Remember to use your Mathletics account and have fun with maths!!!
Joke Time…
I can’t remember how to write 51, 6 and 500 in Roman numerals.
I am
