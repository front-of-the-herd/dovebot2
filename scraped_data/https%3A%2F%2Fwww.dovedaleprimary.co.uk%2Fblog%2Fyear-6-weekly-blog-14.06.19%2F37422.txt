Year 6 Weekly Blog 14.06.19
Date:
14th Jun 2019 @ 4:28pm
All year 6 children have had a very varied experience this week. They've been thrown in together with other children from across the three classes, either at the Isle of Man or back here at base camp. It has been wonderful to see them bond and mix with each other; our children always make us proud to teach at Dovedale.
For a flavour of this weeks activites, follow us on twitter where you will see an array of physical and artistic activites - all in spite of the rather gloomy weather.
After we split up on Monday morning (some heading for the Pier Head; others heading to our school field) it was Mr OToole's group who got stuc straight in with invasion games, capture the flag and a big group game of rounders which was lots of fun. By the time we were packing up to go home at 3.20, Isle of Man children were still seabound with further journeying ahead until arrival at the Venture Centre, dinner, and an evening on the beach to watch the sun set for the rest of the week!
By Friday, children had partaken in water sports, gorge walking, camp craft, den building, crate stacking, high ropes, late nights and a lovely barbeque. Back home, we had created paper mache animals, baked chocolate chip and marshmallow cookies, held exotic animals, spray painted grafitti names and had a party.
A busy week for all. Make sure we are well rested for Monday - it's back to the usual routine (except for pizza making, of course).
