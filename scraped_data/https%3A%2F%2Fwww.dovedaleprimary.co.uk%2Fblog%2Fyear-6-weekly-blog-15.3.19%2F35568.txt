Year 6 Weekly blog 15.3.19

Year 6 finished their topic in poetry this week, Finding a Voice.
We looked at the life of a Syrian refugee and gathered ideas for a poem that captured her experiences. From war-torn Syria, to a refugee camp in Lebanon to Bradford in England. Children wrote beautiful work on Friday, and we even managed to incorporate effective rhyming couplets to aid the rhythm of the poetry. The finished results were a delight to read, it has to be said.
Next week, we are beginning a surprise new novel.
In maths, we have had a mix of learning, trying to cover all aspects of year 6 maths curriculum. Arithmetic and reasoning skills are daily practise, and this week, we have also focussed on coordinates, time and timetables with some very challenging reasoning tasks to extend the learning. We also now send basic skills sheets home each week to continue to work on the important areas of maths learning that will support us in the build up to SATs.
In science, children have been studying adaptation and inheritance, learning some very interesting facts about different animals and plants and how they suit their environments. Very interesting discussions are taking place each lesson.
In history, we were investigating Saxon Britain and the various punishments and sanctions for different crimes in those times. We first studied the Saxon influence chronologically and then learned about the justice systems in place in those times for Britain.
Comic Relief was a huge success and Mrs Cannon organised a wonderful assembly in which year 6 teachers were faced by year 6 pupils in a general knowledge / maths quiz in front of the audience. Unfortunately, year 6 teachers were narrowly beaten by the children’s team but we were mightily impressed by the knowledge and skills of the children - even though it was a fix!
