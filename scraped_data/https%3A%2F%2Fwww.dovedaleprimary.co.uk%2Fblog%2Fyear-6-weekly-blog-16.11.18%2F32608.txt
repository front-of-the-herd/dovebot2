This week, Year 6 children have been building up to writing an opening chapter for an action story. Some of the work they have produced has been fantastic. On Tuesday, children built their own Action Vocabulary bank and began jotting setting description ideas for action stories. On Wednesday and Thursday, they looked at good examples of action writing, creating their own voice-over for a film and and a blurb for an action story. On Friday, the action writing was wonderful, and it really kept the teachers on the edges of our seats!
In maths, children have consolidated their understanding of frations in arithmetic lessons by converting, ordering, adding and subtracting fractions. This week we have had a huge focus on these key areas of understanding, and we have been tackling reasoning questions related to fractions that require conversion of numerator and denominator in order to solve problems. What is apparent, is that times tables knowledge is paramount for this type of learning, and children continue to impress us with their increased understanding of tables and quick recall. Mr O'Toole was impressed with his times tables leader board this week - Munah tops the list with 2m 01s, and all 12 children on the board have a time under 4 minutes for completing the tables grid.
Hit the Button is proving to be a popular choice for children in year 6 and it is highly competative at the moment! Our fastest time for 8 times table is 35 answers in 1 minute for Kenu. And for U + U + U it is 24 answers in 1 minute for Ali. We are trying to beat these times and hope to make the competition spread between classes! Game on!
Anti-bullying week was a success in the afternoons, and children held a class debate on Wednesday over issues that impact on all our lives. The big question was, 'Is there ever such a thing as an innocent bystander' where bullying is concerned? We used these ideas to make our own storyboards on Thursday and children managed to portray powerful messages for our Anti-bullying theme - Choose Respect.
We look forward to completing some practise SATs papers closer to the Christmas holidays as we feel children are ready to show off all they have learned this term in maths, reading and SPAG. We ask that parents encourage children to continue to read as often as possible at home and are listened to, and we also ask for homework to completed on time.
