Year 6 Weekly Blog 17.05.19

Well done to all our fantastic year 6s who applied themselves fully and made the whole school proud this week with their tremendous efforts in SATs week!
We don't think children could have given any more than they did.
On Monday, the nerves were evident for some when we started the ball rolling with a Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar test. The day began with toast club, and some music in the classroom, and this kept us as calm and relaxed as possible. Despite the nerves and jitters, all children were clearly focussed and ready as they worked their way through a quite challenging paper. Afterwards, we all agreed that the paper wasn't too bad and the preparation for it was worth the effort!
After taking on the mentally draining papers from Monday to Thursday, children still had fuel left in the tank to attempt revision sessions in the afternoons, knowing that this was our final push! And each child made their teacher proud by tackling the revision witha  smile on their face.
By Thursday, we were calm, relaxed and ready for our final maths paper. Listening to children talk afterwards gave the teachers something to smile about this time, as year 6s discussed the problems, how they approached them, what methods they used, and how much they enjoyed the challenge! It was time to celebrate, and we spent the rest of the day enjoying games and activities with an ice lolly on our school field.
Friday was fun! We enjoyed a movie and board games with own clothes and just relxed  after a very tiring and adrenaline fuelled week.
Well done again to our fabulous team in year 6. A wonderful effort all round!
