Year 6 Weekly Blog 22.03.19
Date:
24th Mar 2019 @ 4:54pm
This week in English, Year 6 began a new text, The Tulip Touch, and began to learn about some very intriguing characters of a similar age to our cohort, and, after an analysis of the main character and those most closely linked to her in the story, we wrote a diary entry to explore the idea of unlikely friendships and contrasting lifestyles.
In maths we have been hammering fractions, addition and subtraction, arithmetic and all manner of reasoning tasks to help us prepare for SATs in May. We are so proud of our year 6s and are already delighted with their achievements this year. Despite SATs tests in May, we think you are all stars and we are delighted with the skills and knowledge that you have developed, ready to take forwards into senior school next year.
Crime and Punishment has proved a popular topic in history, and this week, year 6 children researched the life of a Victorian policeman (‘Bobbies’ - in short - or ‘Peelers’ after their founder, Robert Peel). We wrote a police log from the perspective off a Victorian Peeler, describing events they might see on London streets - from con men and pick pockets to vagrants and pet kidnappers.
In science we have been learning about variation in species and we investigated variation amongst 11 year olds, presenting data to show differences in height, arm length, eye/ hair colour and shoe size. In 6OT, it seems brown eyes are truly the dominant gene!
Roy Lichtenstein was the subject of some investigation in Art, linking nicely to our topic - Comic Strips. Check out our own take on his works, using our twitter account. You will be impressed by our Lichtenstein inspired creations.
See you on Monday. Don’t forget your homework!
