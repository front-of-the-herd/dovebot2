Year 6 Weekly Blog 28.09.18
Date:
28th Sep 2018 @ 4:29pm
A new topic for English this week as year 6 children discussed autobiographies and looked at the features of the most successful biographies - rating their effectiveness by the impact the writing features have on the reader. We began to look at the life of Ann Frank and her autobiographical accounts of World War II, and we finished off the week with an immersive writing task which involved a virtual tour around the famous Anne Frank Annex.
In maths, children have been working really hard with place value tasks to do with rounding, negative numbers and ordering numbers - all reflective of the homework tasks set over the past two weeks, and again yesterday. It is lovely to mark this homework and see the progress of the children. Please check this and see if your child needs any support. Thank you.
In science we continue to delve deeper into the human circulatory system, and have been exploring the valves and blood vessels, discussing the relevance of each component and the vital role each plays in this wonderful system.
Children began to put their ideas together in History for a presentation on Maya religion, temples and gods. We spent an afternoon gathering ideas and working in teams to create our presentations and we are looking forward to seeing the results next week. If any more information can be gathered over the weekend for this task, please spend some time doing so.
