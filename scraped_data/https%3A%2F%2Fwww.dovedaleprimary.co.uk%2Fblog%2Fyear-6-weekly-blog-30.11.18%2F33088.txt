Year 6 Weekly Blog 30.11.18

Year 6 have been writing biographies for the life of Charles Dickens. Over the next few weeks, we will be looking at some of his greatest works, including David Copperfield and A Christmas Carol.
Our year 6 children thought carefully about how to write the events of his life in a way that really hooked the reader. Instead of 'Charles Dickens was born...' we instead had, 'When you think of great authors...' and 'In the early years of the 19th Century, one of the most influential and revolutionary authors was brought into the world'. Our biographies were superb and really captured the essence of Dickens' life, both the ups and downs, and the inspirations behind his great works.
Next week we take a look at his semi-autobiographical novel, David Copperfield - arguably his best - and will analyse the characters and settings of the Victorian era he wrote so well.
In maths, our children exuded confidence with fraction work this week. We know they have consolidated their knowledge of fractions of amounts, equivalent fractions and multiplying, dividing, adding and subtracting fractions. How do we know? Arithmetic scores have gone through the roof!
In science, we took an in depth look at the highstreet food products from our own cupboards, the Recommended Daily Allowance of nutritional content, and compared this to our age related allowance of sugars, fats and calories. The results were so surprising - Doritos appeared to be the most unhealthy food - but not bad as a snack. unfortunately for Mr O'Toole's daughter, Curiously Cinnamon Golden Grahams have now been banned from the O'Toole household thanks to Year 6's research and findings. They topped the unhealthy scale for sugar calories and all-round badness per 100g!
Next week, author Tom Farrell re-visits Dovedale to talk to year 6 about his new book. Last time he was here, the author/Olympian/evacuee gave us great insight into recent and local history - and this time we are excited to hear more about the unique events of his life.
Copies of his book are available to by in paper copy and hardback if you see the office.
The Year 6 team.
