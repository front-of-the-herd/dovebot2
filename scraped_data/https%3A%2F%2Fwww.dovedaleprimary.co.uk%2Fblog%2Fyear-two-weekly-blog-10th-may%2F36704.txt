Year Two Weekly Blog, 10th May
Date:
10th May 2019 @ 12:46pm
The children have had an extremely busy week this week and the staff are very proud of how hard everyone has worked. We have particularly enjoyed our science lesson where we planted a range of different seeds. We will observe their growth over the next few weeks. The children also came up with some fantastic questions that we will investigate in our forthcoming lessons and some brilliant predictions. We have also enjoyed an afternoon of art linked to our science topic of plants. We used magnifying glasses to observe different flower petals closely and then chose our own media to represent the shapes, pattern, colours and textures we could see. In English we finished reading our class text 'Dougal's Deep Sea Diary' and have written postcards and letters linked to the story.
Next week we will begin a new text, 'Journey' by Aaron Becker which is a wordless text. We will focus on the storyline and plot which is portrayed through the illustrations and make predictions and inferences about what will happen. We will then start to think of ideas for our own adventure story and where a magic door might take us. In Geography we will compare our city of Liverpool with Rio De Janeiro considering both the human and physical features of both cities and their famous landmarks.
