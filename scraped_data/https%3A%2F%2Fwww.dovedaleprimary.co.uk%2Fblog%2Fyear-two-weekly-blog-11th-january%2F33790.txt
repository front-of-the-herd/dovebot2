Happy New Year!
The children in year two have come back after the Christmas break full of enthusiasm for the new term ahead. This week we have started our new geography topic about the continent of Africa. We have located Africa on a world map and globe, used google earth to explore the continent and begun  to make our own maps showing the different landscapes including desert, rainforest and savannah. Our text in English, 'Lila and the Secret of Rain' which is set in Kenya, has been linked to this topic and children have thoroughly enjoyed reading, dramatising and re-writing the story. In maths we have continued our learning about money, including calculating difference, change and using multiplication statements to match groups of the same denomination of coin. Our new science topic is entitled animals including humans and this week we have started to think about looking after our bodies and keeping healthy. Children learnt about the food pyramid and the Eatwell plate and were introduced to different food groups.
Next week we will move on further with mutrliplication including recalling facts from the 2, 5 and 10 times tables. We will use the book 'The Ugly Five' as our stimulus in English and will add geographical features to our African maps. We will also further our knowledge and understanding of food groups and nutrition including learning about carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, minerals and calcium.
