Year Two Weekly Blog, 15th February
Date:
15th Feb 2019 @ 4:11pm
We've reached the end of a very busy yet successful half term in Year Two. This week children have thoroughly enjoyed watching 'Catch It', an animation set on the African savannah. They have got into role as the vulture and written some fantastic monologues from the vulture's point of view. They have also enjoyed a week of geometry in maths in which we have looked at the properties of 2D and 3D shape including symmetry and repeating patterns. We had a great science lesson learning about the life cycle of humans and how we change as we grow older. We used the aging booth app on the ipads to take photos of each other to see how we might look in the future - scary!
After half term our topic on Africa continues and children will enjoy an African drumming and dance workshop. We will move onto fractions in maths and our science topic will be living things and their habitats. In art we will begin to make our clay pots. Our English text will be The Dragon Machine by Helen Ward.
Thank you for your continued support, wishing you all a lovely half term.
