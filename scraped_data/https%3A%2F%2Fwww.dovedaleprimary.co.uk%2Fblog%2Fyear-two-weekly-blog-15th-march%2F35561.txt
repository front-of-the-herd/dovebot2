Year Two Weekly Blog, 15th March
Date:
15th Mar 2019 @ 4:04pm
Year Two have had another busy week with lots of activities to enjoy. All four classes have now had their visit to Allerton library where they were given a brief talk by one of the librarians about how to use the library and were read the story of 'Flat Stanley'. Many of the children chose a book to bring home and share with you, please remember to return this to the library once you have finished reading it. As well as library visits, all children have taken part in yoga sessions which will continue each week for the foreseeable future.
Next week we will come to the end of our English text 'The Dragon Machine' which the children have thoroughly enjoyed. We will write our own stories based on this book, thinking of our own characters and events. In maths we will move onto measuring length using standard units and carry out length investigations such as 'When children are taller, their feet are bigger. True or false?' We will begin to learn about food chains in science and how living things in habitats are dependant on one another. In Geography we will compare African village life with life in an African city and we will design our African pots which we will make out of clay.
