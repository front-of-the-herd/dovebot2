Year Two Weekly Blog, 16th November
Date:
16th Nov 2018 @ 3:51pm
This week has been another exciting and successful week in Year Two. In English we have been studying the features of instructional texts and enjoyed writing a set of instructions for how to make a jam sandwich (of course we had to make one ourselves first). Then on Thursday we all made bread, which looked, smelt and tasted amazing. We wrote up our recipe including the ingredients and instructions in our English lesson this morning. In maths we have continued to practise addition using the column method, focussing particularly on adding two 2 digit numbers with an exchange of ten ones for a ten. We began our history topic about the Great Fire of London by looking at different artefacts and have spent time thinking about the word 'respect' as part of anti-bullying week.
Next week we will read the story 'Toby and the Great Fire of London' and write our own version of the story. We will use empty numberlines in maths as a strategy to solve subtraction calculations and we will continue learning about the sequence of events leading up to and during the Great Fire. We will also practice cutting and joining skills in art using a range of fabrics and will learn about solids, liquids and gases in science.
