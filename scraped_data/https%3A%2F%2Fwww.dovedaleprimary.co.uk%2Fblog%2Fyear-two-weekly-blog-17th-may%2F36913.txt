Year Two Weekly Blog, 17th May
Date:
17th May 2019 @ 3:58pm
This week the children in Year Two have loved reading our new text, 'Journey' by Aaron Becker. The text is a wordless book with detailed illustrations depicting the story. We have made some fantastic predictions and have had such brilliant discussions about the characters, settings and events. Next week we will plan and write our own adventure stories based on this book.
In maths this week we have been recapping strategies for all four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and been thinking carefully about how we can use known number facts to help us with our calculations. Next week we will use number bonds to ten, twenty and one hundred to reason and solve problems.
In geography this week we have compared the human and physical georgraphical featutures of Liverpool and Rio De Janeiro. We found out that both cities have very similar features. Next week we will begin to look at seasonal weather changes and find out about climate zones around the world.
In science we have observed the growth of our seeds that we planted last week. We can't believe how much they have changed in only one week. We now have roots, shoots and even some leaves. We have also planted some more bean seeds in different conditions to observe how well they grow. Next week we will begin to learn about the parts of plants and their function.
