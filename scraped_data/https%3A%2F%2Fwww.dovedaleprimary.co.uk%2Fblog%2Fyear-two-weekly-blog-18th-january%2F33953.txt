Year Two Weekly Blog, 18th January
Date:
18th Jan 2019 @ 12:18pm
What a busy week it's been again in year two! This week we have loved reading 'The Ugly Five' by Julia Donaldson and have really enjoyed finding out about the animals featured in more detail. Towards the end of the week we all wrote an animal riddle for our classmates to solve. Check our Twitter feed for some great videos! We also continued with our topic of multiplication in maths. The pupils have gained a fantastic understanding of this concept and are beginning to recall multiplication facts from memory. In Geography we continued making our own maps of Africa, adding features such as the Sahara Desert, Mount Kilimanjaro, The River Nile and labelling both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. In science we learnt more about different food groups and found out why our bodies need things such as carbohydrates, protein and calcium. We enjoyed designing our own healthy lunchbox although some of our combinations were a bit strange!
Next week we will find out about the importance of storytelling in African Culture and will write our own tale based on 'How the Zebra Got it's Stripes.' We will begin to link multiplication to division and explore division through sharing and grouping. In science we will carry out an investigation into the effects of exercise on our bodies and we will look in more detail at the country of Kenya in our geography lesson.
