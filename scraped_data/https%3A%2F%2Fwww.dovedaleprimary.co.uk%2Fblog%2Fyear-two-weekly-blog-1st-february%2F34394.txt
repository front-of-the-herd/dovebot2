Year Two Weekly Blog, 1st February
Date:
1st Feb 2019 @ 3:41pm
This week we have all really enjoyed continuing our learning about Africa and African animals and have started to research facts about the big five. We will use this information to write a non-chronological report next week. In maths we have moved onto statistics and begun using tally charts to display information and data. We have also been interpreting data from a tally chart and answering questions. In science we learnt about the importance of hygiene, particularly washing hands. We did an experiement using glitter to show how easily germs can be spread from person to person and wrote a set of instructions for good handwashing. We began looking at African artwork with a focus on pattern and colour and we thoroughly enjoyed looking at many of the wonderful African artefacts the children have brought into school. Thank you for sharing these with us!
Next week children will begin their writing about one of the big five African animals. We will learn about Chinese New Year and we will learn about the significance of pattern in African culture.
