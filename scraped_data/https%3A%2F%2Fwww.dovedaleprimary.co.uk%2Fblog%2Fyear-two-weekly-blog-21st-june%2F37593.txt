Year Two Weekly Blog, 21st June
Date:
21st Jun 2019 @ 4:25pm
This week Year Two have begun practising for their forthcoming production of Pirates Versus Mermaids. Many of the children have brought home lines to learn and we would really appreciate any help you can offer at home to support them in learning these. We have also been recapping over previous learning in maths including inverse relationships and fact families. We have also learnt about different biomes across the world in Geography and in English we have been retelling the story 'Bubbles', which is a short animation telling the story of how a lonely girl finds happiness in a tube of bubbles when she is transported into fantasy. The children have also all participated in a fantastic art workshop with local artist Becky Barnett in which they have used the natural die from flowers to create some stunning pieces of work. In class we have produced beautiful manadal artwork using the natural materials the children brought in from home.
Next week we will be extremely busy with performance rehearsals but will also find time for some data handling in maths including tally charts and block graphs and we we also begin to think about 'belonging' in RE.
