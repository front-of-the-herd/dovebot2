Year Two Weekly Blog, 25th January
Date:
28th Jan 2019 @ 7:37am
It's been a great week in Year two. This week we have been writing our own stories in the style of the African Tale, 'How the Zebra Got it's Stripes.' We thought of our own African animal with a distinctive feature and wrote a story about how the animal came to develop this feature. The children came up with some extremely imaginative ideas. In Maths we have continued our topic on multiplication and division and the children are beginning to recall lots of times table facts from memory. We learnt about some human and physical geographical features of Kenya in our geography lesson and wrote some excellent descriptions of the Masai Mara using lots of geographical vocabulary we have learnt. In science we investigated the effects of exercise on our bodies and even made our own fitness videos to encourage other people to try to exercise regularly!
Next week we will begin a unit of work writing non-chronological reports about African animals. We will look particularly at the features of this text type and focus on writing an introduction to our report. In maths we will move on to some work on statistics and will use tally charts to interpret data and information. We will begin our art project of making African clay pots and we will learn about hygiene and the importance of hand washing in science.
Your child should have brought home a piece of homwork to research a given African animal. We would really appreciate it if you could spend a little time with your child completing this, as this will be used to inform their writing next week. Many thanks.
