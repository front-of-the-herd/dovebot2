Year Two Weekly Blog, 26th April
Date:
26th Apr 2019 @ 3:51pm
What a lovely first week back we have had after the Easter break. In English we have begun a new text, Dougal's Deep-Sea Diary which has lead on to us finding out about some of the problems that sharks face today. We have learnt that many species of shark are at risk of extinction due to overfishing and habitat loss and we have written some brilliant reports about this issue and what we can do to help. The children have been so engaged that as a year group we have adopted a shiver of white sharks. Our donation will fund vital research which will have a big impact on their conservation.
In maths we have been measuring mass using grams and kilograms and we have started a new geography topic about planet earth.
Next week we wil continue with our English text with a focus on writing newpaper reports. We will  measure capacity in maths and begin a new science topic all about plants.
