Year Two Weekly Blog, 28th June
Date:
28th Jun 2019 @ 12:11pm
We've had an extremely busy week in year two rehearsing for our upcoming performance. The children have worked really hard to learn their lines and our dancers and actors are doing a great job too. In addition to this we have been thinking about belonging in RE and we have read a lovely book called 'The Colour of Home' to explore the idea of being forced to leave your home and what this must feel like. This morning we had a great time on the field for sports day. Well done to everyone!
