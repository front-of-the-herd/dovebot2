Year Two Weekly Blog, 29th March
Date:
29th Mar 2019 @ 3:41pm
This week we have enjoyed lots of different things. We have started to read our new text 'Tadpole's Promise' which the children have loved. They've produced lots of fantastic pieces of writing linked to the story including letters to 'Agony Agnes', the local agony aunt! In maths we have focussed on position and direction using vocabulary such as left, right, clockwise, anti-clockwise, quarter turn, half turn, full turn. In history we had some disgusting artefacts to explore which lead to us finding out about the life and work of Florence Nightingale and in art we have finally made our African clay pots.
Next week we will continue with the story 'Tadpole's Promise' and write our own alternative endings. We will move onto time in maths and learn to read and tell the time on an analogue clock at o'clock, half past, quarter past and quarter to the hour. We will also solve problems involving duration of time. In art we will paint and evaluate our clay pots and in history we will continue learning all about the work of Florence Nightingale and the impact she had on nursing today.
