Year Two Weekly Blog, 2nd Novemer

2nd Nov 2018 @ 3:59pm
What a great first week back! Thank you to all the children who helped collect such a fantastic range of Autumnal items over half term. We loved using these as inspiration to write our own Autumn poems this week. In maths we have been adding and subtracting multiples of ten to 2 digit numbers and noticing what happens to each digit. We have been learning to record our calculations using the column method. In history we began learning about Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot. We worked together to sequence the main events and found out about why we celebrate Firework Night each year on 5th November. In science we explored how materials can be changed by twisting, bending, pushing, pulling, stretching and squashing.
Next week we will continue learning about Guy Fawkes and use non-fiction texts to find out more information about his life. We will discuss our own opinions about the Gunpowder Plot and whether we thought Guy Fawkes was right to try to kill King James. We will write a persuasive argument giving the facts and our own point of view. In maths we will continue practicing using the column method to record our addition and subtraction calculations and will begin to learn how to exchange ten ones for a ten when we don't have enough ones to subtract. As Remembrance Day is approaching the children will learn about the significance of the Poppy, why we wear them and will then work together to create a large wreath of Poppies to be displayed in school. We will also carry out an investigation to explore reversible and irreversible changes a part of our materials topic in science.
