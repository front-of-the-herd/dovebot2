Year Two Weekly Blog, 3rd May
Date:
3rd May 2019 @ 8:31am
We've had another busy week in Year Two. This week we have written newspaper reports linked to our text 'Dougal's Deep-Sea Diary.' The children have learnt about the features of news reports and explored what makes an effective headline. In maths we have been measuring capacity and temperature and reading scales with different intervals. We have been using atlases to locate different countries on a world map in Geography and we have been observing and classifying different seeds in science.
Next week we will complete our text in English and write postcards and letters linked to the story. We will recap different strategies for the four operations in maths - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In science we will begin to investigate growing seeds and plant different seeds in different conditions. We will continue using world maps and globes in Geography to locate areas of the world.
