Year Two Weekly Blog, 5th July
Date:
5th Jul 2019 @ 3:53pm
This week the children in year two have all enjoyed meeting their new teachers for September. They have had a tour of the Junior department building and had the opportunity to ask any questions they may have about the transition to Key Stage Two. 2M and 2W put on a brilliant show of Pirates Versus Mermaids for 2G, 2D and all of Year 1 - parents, you are in for a treat on Monday!
Next week we will begin out DT unit, Wheels and Axles. The children will be designing, making and evaluating a moving vehicle. We will begin by exploring existing products by playing with a range of toy vehicles, observing how they move and the parts needed to do this. We will then look at different ways of making axle holders and the children will have chance to practise making these. They will then design their vehicle, listing the resources they will require and considering the joining techniques they will use. After making their vehicles, the will peer and self evaluate the success of them including the design, how well they move and how durable they are.
