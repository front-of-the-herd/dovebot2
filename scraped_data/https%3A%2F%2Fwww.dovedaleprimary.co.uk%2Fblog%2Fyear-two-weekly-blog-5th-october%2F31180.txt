Year Two Weekly Blog 5th October
Date:
5th Oct 2018 @ 4:10pm
It's been another excellent week in Year Two.
The children have become authors of their own stories featuring their favourite cuddly toys. They had some brilliant ideas and have written some fantastic stories using conjunctions to join their sentences and expanded noun phrases to add detail. Our topic in maths has been addition and subtraction and the children have used practical equipment, models and images to represent fact families. They have also been using their addition and subtraction skills to solve problems. In science the children carried out group investigations to find out which material would be most durable and hard wearing to make a pair of children's dungarees. They tested different fabrics by rubbing them on the ground and counting how many rubs it took until the fabric frayed or ripped. The result was........denim is the most suitable. In history, the children worked in groups to hunt for a series of envelopes which contained historical clues. The envelopes contained artefacts such as newspaper cuttings, photographs, letters, ration books and air-raid precautions. The children soon realised that all the artefacts were linked to World War Two and they then came up with some fantastic questions that we will research in subsequent lessons.
Next week we will read the story Amazing Grace by Mary Hoffman. We will use the illustrations to help us make predictions and make inferences and we will use the story to learn about present and past tense verbs. In maths we will be comparing number sentences and calculating missing numbers in addition and subtraction statements. We will use the iPads in history to research aspects of World War Two and we will continue our artwork based on the work of Sandra Hepworth and use different media to practise sketching.
