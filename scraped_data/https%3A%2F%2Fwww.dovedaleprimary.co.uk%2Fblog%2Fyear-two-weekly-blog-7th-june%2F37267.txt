Year Two Weekly Blog, 7th June
Date:
7th Jun 2019 @ 3:48pm
We've had a great first week back after the half term break. On Tuesday morning we were surprised to find moon rocks, alien slime and astronaut clothing in our classrooms!! These were all to do with our new English text, The Man on the Moon, which is another story written by Simon Bartram. We've loved reading the text and also researching facts about the moon. In maths we have been recapping telling the time on an analogue clock at o'clock, half past, quarter past and quarter to the hour. We have also begun to read times at five minute intervals and are becoming much more confident at this. In science we have written leaflets about how to grow runner beans and observed the changes that have happened to our seeds we planed in different conditions.
Next week will be, for many, the most exciting week of the academic year as we set off on our residential visit to Barnstondale. We are all really looking forward to the experiences this will bring and the staff remaining at school have planned some brilliant activities for the children staying behind as well.
