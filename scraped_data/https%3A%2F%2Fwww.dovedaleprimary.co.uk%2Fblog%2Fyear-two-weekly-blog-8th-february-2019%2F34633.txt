Year Two Weekly Blog, 8th February 2019
Date:
8th Feb 2019 @ 3:56pm
We've been extremely busy this week in Year Two writing our reports about the Big Five African animals. We've been amazed with how many interesting facts the children have found out and how well they've been able to write in detail about their given animal. The writing produced has been of such a good standard and the children have been extremely engaged and motivated to write all week. Thank you for helping at home, it has been fantastic to see how much effort has gone into the posters, models and booklets the children have produced. In other areas of the curriculum we have been reading and interpreting data from pictograms and tally charts and making our own block diagrams. We have learnt about Chinese New Year and produced some lovely creative work which is now displayed in the Key Stage One corridor and we have used the ipads to take portrait photos which we have then edited. In art we have explored the significance of African geometrical patterns and the meanings behind the shapes and have begun to practice recreating our own.
Next week we will use a short animation set on the African plains as a stimulus for our writing. We will explore how characters feel at different points in the story and use this to write a monologue from the perspective of one of the characters. In maths we will move onto 2D and 3D shape including recognising features and exploring reflective symmetry. In science we will learn about how we change from a baby through to adulthood and will look at baby photographs of the teachers and children. Please send a photograph of your child as a baby into school for them to use in this lesson. All photos will be returned to you. In our art lesson we will contiue exploring African pattern and use a variety of different media to create our own and for computing we will use Pic Collage as a way of presenting our portrait photographs.
