Year Two Weekly Blog, 9th November
Date:
9th Nov 2018 @ 4:01pm
We've had an extremely busy week this week in year two. The children have loved continuing their learning about Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot and have created some fantastic persuasive writing debating the question "should Guy Fawkes have been put to death for his crimes?"
In science we found out something extremely surprising, a Cadbury flake bar will not melt! We also learnt about reversible and irreversible changes and that melting chocolate buttons is a reversible change - the chocolate began as a solid, changed to a liquid and then changed back to a solid again.
We found out about the significance of Remembrance Day and why people wear poppies at this time of year. We each made a collage poppy and used this to create a large year group wreath which looks beautiful as part of our Key Stage One remembrance display.
Next week we will study instructional texts in English and write our own set of instructions about something exciting we will make on Thursday....watch this space! We will also be thinking about anti-bullying in our classes next week, with a particular focus on the word RESPECT.,
