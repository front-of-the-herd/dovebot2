Cookies are small text files stored on your computer by your browser. They're used for many things, such as remembering whether you've visited the site before, so that you remain logged in - or to help us work out how many new website visitors we get each month. They contain information about the use of your computer but don't include personal information about you (they don't store your name, for instance).
About this Cookie policy
This Cookie Policy applies to all of our websites and our mobile applications ("the Website").
By accessing the Website, you agree that this Cookie Policy will apply whenever you access the Website on any device.
