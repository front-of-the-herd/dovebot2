Applying for a place at Dovedale Primary School
To apply for a place in Reception you need to apply through the Local Authority. As a community school the following criteria is used to allocate places:
1. Looked After Children
2. Medical or social needs
3. Siblings
4. Nearness to the school
The link below will take you directly to the admissions page of the Local Authority website:
http://liverpool.gov.uk/schools-and-learning/school-admissions/
If you would like to transfer your child to our school the procedure is now to contact us directly if they are in Year 1 to 6. You can contact us directly in the spring term if you have a Reception child and would like to transfer them. In the autumn term you need to contact the Local Authority as they manage the process in this first term. We have a registering interest form which needs to be completed and returned to us.  If we do not have a space you will be placed on our 'waiting list'. We will contact you if a place becomes available. A new application needs to be made each term if you would like to transfer your child to Dovedale.
If you are new to the country or new to Liverpool you will need to apply for a school place through the local authority. Click on the link below to apply:
