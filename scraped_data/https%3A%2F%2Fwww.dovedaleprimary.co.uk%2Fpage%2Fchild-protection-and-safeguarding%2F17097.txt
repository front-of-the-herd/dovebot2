PREVENT
As part of Dovedale Primary School's commitment to safeguarding and child protection we fully support the government's
Prevent Duty Guidance.
What is Prevent ?
The aim of Prevent is to stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism.
The objectives of Prevent are to:
tackle the ideological causes of terrorism
intervene early to support people susceptible to radicalisation
enable people who have already engaged in terrorism to disengage and rehabilitate
