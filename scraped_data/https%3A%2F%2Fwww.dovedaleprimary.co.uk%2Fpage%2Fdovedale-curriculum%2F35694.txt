Dovedale Primary School Curriculum
At Dovedale Primary School, we believe that our children learn best when lessons are stimulating, engaging and challenging.  Our primary focus is to raise aspirations, foster a sense of personal pride in achievement and provide a purpose and relevance for learning.  Each unit and lessons are relevant to the needs of our children and the community and planned with a clear intended learning outcome, linked to the key building blocks for each subject.
Intent:
We want to ensure our children, including those with SEND and vulnerable children are learning for life.  We provide learning experiences which aim to develop long term, memorable knowledge, understanding and skills.  We understand that long term, deeper knowledge grows when links are made between concepts, which build on prior knowledge and are applied in different contexts.
Our priority is to improve our pupils’ knowledge and broaden their life experiences.  We strive to build resilience; we want our pupils to believe in themselves.  We aim to provide equal access for all learners, to promote a love of learning, a range of life experiences and exciting learning opportunities. We want our children to be aware of both the wider world and their own spiritual, social, emotional and physical development, ensuring they are ready for the next stage of their learning.
Implementation:
We embrace the need for an ever-evolving curriculum.  Our curriculum is carefully planned to facilitate links between learning and clear progression within subjects.  To ensure learning builds systematically on prior knowledge, we have identified the key learning for each subject within a progressive framework throughout the school.  Pre-learning tasks or a learning retention activity are completed prior to planning for teaching and learning.  Planning ensures key learning is developed and opportunities to review and consolidate learning are embedded.
The love of reading and literature is a key priority in every subject.  Purposeful, quality texts are linked throughout our curriculum.  Our pupils are supported to research independently and learn relevant subject-specific skills.  By enabling them to become independent learners, they will be equipped with the resilience and ambition to Imagine, Believe and Achieve.
Educational experiences such as workshops, trips and special visitors complement and enrich our pupils’ learning, and our curriculum is further enhanced with extra-curricular clubs and activities.
Impact:
We are able to evaluate progress for each child as we have identified the key learning in each subject.  Our effective subject teams across the school work in partnership with our Assessment and Curriculum Leaders to accurately evaluate each subject and therefore ensure high standards across all subjects within our school.  The impact of our curriculum is monitored through book looks, data, pupil voice and lesson observations.
