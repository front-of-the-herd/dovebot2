Forest School
Forest School is rooted in evidence-based research and offers a wealth of benefits, including increased confidence, social and communication skills, and improved mental and physical health.  Sessions are both child-centred and child-led, and use the natural environment to facilitate a holistic learning journey of nurture and discovery.

Forest School in development
The development of our Forest School has been a community effort, with volunteer workers, community donators and artistic and visionary parents and staff, who, together, have created a wonderful outdoor learning experience with fantastic opporunities for our children to flourish, build character, work collaboratively, solve problems and understand the world through nature.
