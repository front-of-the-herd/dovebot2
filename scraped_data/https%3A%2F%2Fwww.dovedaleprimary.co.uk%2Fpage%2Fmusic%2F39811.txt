Music
Intent
Our intent when we teach music is to allow all of our children, including those with SEND and vulnerable pupils, a way to communicate, appreciate and to inspire.
We want to provide them with the chance, skills, and confidence to utilise music to express and explore emotion.
We want our children to be able to use music to transcend race, SEND, countries, religion, and language barriers.
We want to expose our children to a broad mix of musicians, genres, and styles so that they can appreciate and appraise music while also being inspired to create their own.
Implementation
The music curriculum has been carefully constructed, with learning opportunities and assessment milestones tailored to each year group to ensure progression and repetition of critical learning, knowledge, and abilities. All work in music is underpinned by subject-specific characteristics that we expect the children to demonstrate.
Through evaluation & theory of music
We'll combine actions with new musical terminology to offer children the confidence to utilise musical vocabulary regardless of their ability, EAL, or other linguistic barriers.
By listening to, debating, and engaging with their music, we will introduce our children to a musical repertoire of influential composers, increasing their knowledge and cultural capital.
These composers are representatives of artists who have utilised music to overcome race, age, country, religion, and financial barriers.
This musical repertoire will help children develop a love of music by allowing them to draw connections between musicians and create a musical timeline.
Our youngsters learn the terminology needed to fluently discuss and critically evaluate music while listening to high-quality live and recorded music. Pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, and structure are all things they can comment on.
We examine the feelings represented and/or what the music is intending to communicate as we critically engage with the music.
These carefully selected pieces are also used to teach and explore musical notation, allowing children to use their growing aural memory to reproduce sounds with accuracy and control.
Through practical & performance of music
We allow our children to explore and use a variety of untuned instruments
We educate children how to communicate musically using a medium that is not hampered by deprivation. As a result, we'll concentrate on the skills required for singing. However, children in years 4 will be taught to play the ukulele and flute in order to further enhance their skills.
We will begin to explore notation through singing and instrumental practice on both tuned and untuned instruments, giving our children opportunity to explore pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, and structure.
We provide opportunities for our children to play and perform in solo and ensemble settings, allowing them to improve their accuracy, fluency, control, and expression while using their voices and playing musical instruments.
As part of our extracurricular programme, we offer additional guitar and keyboard lessons, as well as a choir, which all build on the abilities that students have already learned while playing the ukulele and flute and allow them to advance to the next level of musical proficiency. While also ensuring that they are given more opportunity to perform.
Impact
Our students will advance intellectually, emotionally, creatively, and socially in music, regardless of where they begin. Knowledge, understanding, and abilities will be strengthened and embedded so that students can reach their maximum potential and be properly prepared for secondary school. They will recognise that music is a means of communication and will listen to and explore music from various eras, cultures, and genres with respect. They will gain knowledge and cultural capital as well as an understanding that they, too, can communicate through music with resilience, regardless of affluence, special needs, cultural heritage, religious belief, or age. The musical repertoire they are exposed to should serve to instil a passion of music in our children.
They will take pride in all they do and strive to be the best at it. When confronted with a problem, they will show resiliency and the ability to persevere. They will gain confidence in their own abilities and develop a sense of responsibility and pride as a result of their performance.
Wider Opportunites for Music
Once again we are excited to provide children in Year 4 wiuth Flute and Ukulele lessons. Children will be learning both the Flute and Ukulele throughout this acadaemic year. We cannot wait to see how their skills develop throughout the year.
