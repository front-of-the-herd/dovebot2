Ofsted reports
Thursday 25th April 2024
It is with great pleasure that I can finally share our latest Ofsted report with you!
As a school we are incredibly proud of the report as we do believe it captures our school.
To explain the first paragraph, we had what is called an ungraded inspection which looked to see if the judgement from the last inspection was still the same i.e. good. However, throughout the rigorous inspection the inspectors found evidence to say that if it was a graded inspection,
it is likely that the school would have been judged
‘outstanding’
in all 5 areas
.
Within a section 5 inspection the specific areas that are reported on are:
Quality of education, Behaviour and attitudes, Personal development, Leadership and management and Early years provision.
As you will see in our report all these areas are commented on but not is specific sections.
The inspectors have not given us any areas that they think we need to improve, that is why that section is blank. However, as a school we are always reviewing what we are doing and will keep making improvements to all aspects of school life.
So, this means that Ofsted will be back within the next 12 to 24 months to do a full ‘graded’ inspection which is just the same as the one we have just had, with more inspectors but is just reported differently.
As a school we will continue to do our very best in all we do and provide all our children with a wonderful primary experience.
A huge thank you to our amazing staff and governors for all their hard work and commitment to Dovedale.
And finally, a huge thank you to all parents and carers for your unfailing support; it is greatly appreciated.
We are very proud to be part of Dovedale.
Yours sincerely
NSmith
Mr Nik Smith
Head Teacher
