Children's mental health and wellbeing is Dovedale's number one priority. Our Pastoral Support Team provide skilled support and guidance to children who are experiencing difficulties in learning due to social difficulties, emotional or behavioural problems, bereavement and other areas of pastoral need.
The team support small groups and children on a 1:1 basis - dependent on their specific personal or social issues.
If a child requires pastoral support, a referral may be made by a parent, any member of staff, or the child themselves. Communication is vital for successful outcomes and the team liase regularly with parents and class teachers to ensure all stake-holders remain fully informed.
The Pastoral Team are prominent around the school, from welcoming children at the gate in the morning to monitoring and supporting at playtimes and lunchtimes.
