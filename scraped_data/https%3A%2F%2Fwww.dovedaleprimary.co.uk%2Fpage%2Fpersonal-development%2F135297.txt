Personal Development
Personal Development Statement
The personal development of pupils at Dovedale Primary School is at the centre of our school ethos.  By nurturing our children’s personal development skills, we strive to prepare them for their adult lives, teaching them to understand how to engage with society and providing them with plentiful opportunities to do so.
Our curriculum extends beyond the academic and supports pupils to develop in many diverse aspects of life.  We aim to provide the essential knowledge that pupils need to be educated citizens, preparing pupils for their adult lives, teaching them to understand how to engage with society.
We offer opportunities for pupils to explore and develop their own values and beliefs, spiritual awareness, high standards of personal behaviour, a positive caring attitude towards other people, an understanding of their social and cultural traditions and an appreciation of the diversity and richness of other cultures.
Each year group has created a curriculum which has a variety of rich experiences that build on year on year.

As part of our wider opportunites, we strive to create roles and responsibilities for children to help them flourish as community members, leaders and citizens. For example, children may be ambassadors for Wellbeing, they may be sports leaders or they may be councillors. We offer wide ranges of clubs all year round, ranging from chess and computing to dance and choir. Click on the link below to see some of the ways children represent our school:
