Physical Education
Intent
At Dovedale, PE is significant to our journey, throughout and beyond primary years. From pupils' initial experience of physical education, to their future, using and applying their taught skills. Pupils experience a varied curriculum from Reception to Year 6 and the coaching and guidance they receive provides a skill based platform that benefits their future growth. The National Curriculum for PE has been used to create a whole school Progression of Skills that is fluid and enables both prerequisite and forthcoming learning to be accessed and followed. From this, these skills are then used to create learning outcomes for both teachers and coaches. Accessing, previous years skills and learning and adopting a 'what most pupils should already know' approach creates an inclusive curriculum, with teachers being able to quickly adapt provision so that all learners, including SEND and vulnerable pupils, can develop their skills and access their current skills.
EYFS and Key Stage 1 - focus on:
Fundamentals of spatial awareness, movement, and coordination
Develop children’s physical literacy
Introducing the School Games Values
Pupils learn to creatively express themselves through gymnastics and dance
Developing early use and movement of balls and other equipment
Working with others to send and receive equipment
Taking part in fun, enjoyable tasks that apply skills and accuracy
Improving stamina and resilience when undertaking physical challenges
Lower Key Stage 2 - focus widens and develops:
Building on EYFS and KS1 fundamental movement skills to develop agility, balance and coordination
Demonstrating creativity and control within gymnastics
Broaden children’s physical literacy
Applying the School Games Values
Adding technique and control when using equipment
Working within a team to apply skills in a game scenario
Compete against others in sport and athletics
Develop rhythm, coordination and balance through dance
Upper Key Stage 2 - focus further develops:
Demonstrating creativity and control within gymnastics
Using equipment confidently for tactical and competitive purposes
Demonstrating confident application of the School Games Values
Using fairness and leadership skills within a team
Consolidating and expanding children’s physical literacy
Working with others to allocate roles within a team
Using skills specific to sport/game to enhance technique and tactics
Working outdoors to problem solve and work as a team, when competing against others (OAA)
Adjust speed, pace and methods of moving to suit athletic scenarios
Send and receive with precision and accuracy
Implementation
Using the Get Set PE programme, teachers and coaches deliver weekly consecutive lessons and support each other through professional dialogue, sharing good practice and assessment cues.  This adaptive teaching supports a whole school inclusive approach to PE, with coaches and teachers using their expertise to personalise learning and support those more and less able than their peers. Pupils that benefit from teaching intervention are then more confident when applying these skills in games or sports, which supports their physical and mental wellbeing. This approach and vision is emphasised further with all abilities having opportunities to represent the school in competitions throughout the year, through the Liverpool School Sports Partnership.
Furthermore, there are a number of approaches we take to implement our PE curriculum intent:
Pupil's achievements in and out of school are celebrated within class and during school assemblies
A variety of after schools clubs and extra curricular sports scheduled throughout the school calendar
School Games values implemented into curriculum with fairness, equality and leadership key themes within the whole school approach to PE to underpin our school curriculum principles: Knowledge, Skills, Experiences, Character Development and Oracy
Inclusive practice is integral to the provision of PE, where children can access sessions regardless of the sporting ability and SEND
Within the curriculum, opportunities have been created to revisit key areas of learning from previous years to ensure that skills have been built on and developed
The curriculum at Dovedale is well balanced between games, sports and skill based units
When games and sports are taught, rules of the theme are established to ensure pupils have good grounding to revisit this sport or further themselves beyond the school curriculum
Transferable skills are taught to ensure that they can be accessed across the curriculum and applied to different games/sports
Pupils are given an opportunity to complete in sports competitions against other local schools, organised through the Liverpool School Sports Partnership
Intra school competitions regularly take place throughout the school year to ensure children have the opportunity to participate in competitive sport
Pupils are given the opportunity to take on different roles within sports and games such as organiser, captain or referee
Pupils are assessed throughout the school by their teachers, once every term
Swimming skills are taught in Years 5 and 6 which meet a variety of needs
Impact
Pupils feel recognised and valued as part of the school community. This will support their growth, confidence and wellbeing
Pupils will access activities beyond the curriculum and take advantage of opportunities after school which will allow them to try new sports or continue one they are already enthusiastic about
Pupils will develop good values and principles that will assist them across school and in their future lives
Pupils feel successful in what they can do and use their prior knowledge and experience to develop and achieve their personal best
Pupils will connect to earlier elements of their learning and feel comfortable in approaching their PE sessions from a position of experience
The inclusive approach means there will be something within the Dovedale curriculum for everyone and this will help pupils identify their likes and preferences, to enthuse their PE experience.
Greater awareness of rules and tactics that can be used across PE
Pupils will feel confident in a range of sports as they will be able to link with skills that they have had prior experience of
Skills will be enhanced considerably with pupils competing with a wide range of talents, within and beyond the school gates
Pupils will have a greater awareness of different perspectives within sports and games which will broaden their knowledge and approach when taking part, giving them 'know-how'
Keeping track of pupils achievements against outcomes will prepare for teachers to adapt their practice to tailor sessions to suit individual needs
Essential swimming lessons in KS2 will contribute to a fuller skill development in achieving their goal of swimming confidently, 25m using a range of strokes and provide essential safety skills beyond the primary setting
