Prefects
In Year 6, children will have the opportunity to become school prefects.
School prefects have important jobs to do in order to ensure smooth day-to-day running and organisation of the school day.  Prefects' jobs include: representing our school on open mornings, setting up for sports
activities and events, or monitoring equipment and hallways at playtime - but they are mainly chosen to model the behaviour and attitude of a Dovedale learner to all other children.
Children who wish to be a 'prefect' will be chosen for having a positive and responsible attitude.  It will involve carrying out jobs in their own time which shows a huge commitment to the school.  Badges are given out in an assembly and our children wear them with pride.
Meet Our Dovedale Primary Prefects for 2024-25
These Year 6 prefects have been specifically chosen for demonstrating the following outstanding qualities:
An excellent attitude towards their work
Exemplary behaviour around the school
Consideration towards the whole school community
Striving to push themselves forwards in all they do
Prefect Work
Prefects are expected to give their time to help the day to day running, organisation and celebrating their school. We held an open morning for prospective children and parents thinking
of joining our school. Our prefects did an incredible job as tour guides. Parents were bowled over by their passion for our school and knowledge of our curriculum. Teachers had very little to do; parents were in safe hands with the year 6s.
Here's two superstars describing Forest School.
Our Prefects are well prepared and organised when it comes to events such as food bank donations. They took charge of organising the donations for Food Bank.
What would we do without our wonderful prefects? They were a wonderful help at the MacMillan coffee morning. They helped organise the many cakes that were made and donated by parents - and helped us to sell and raise over £800!
