School of Sanctuary
A School of Sanctuary is a school that is ‘committed to being a safe and welcoming place for all students and their families. It is a school that helps its students, staff and wider community understand what it means to be seeking sanctuary and to extend a welcome to everyone as equal, valued members of the school community. It is a school that is proud to be a place of safety and inclusion for all.’
There are three principles to becoming a School of Sanctuary:
Learn what it means to be seeking sanctuary
Take Positive action to embed concepts of welcome, safety and inclusion within your school and the wider community.
Share your vision and achievements – be proud!
Dovedale Primary School is very proud to have achieved this recognition in 2019 and to have been reaccredited in 2022. Drew Jones led the school to achieve the School of Sanctuary Chartermark through working with staff, pupils and drawing on our wider community to help educate our pupils on matters surrounding ‘seeking sanctuary’ and what we can do to help others. We pride ourselves on our ‘inclusive environment’ here at Dovedale Primary School and believe that achieving the School of Sanctuary Chartermark will help us to develop this even further.
