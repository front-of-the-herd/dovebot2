SEND Support
At Dovedale Primary we know that every child should have access to an education that ensures they have the chance to succeed, whatever their individual needs and the potential barriers to their learning may be.
We recognise the link between the health and well-being of children and young people which contributes to their attainment and achievement. In turn this enables children to thrive and achieve their full potential.
We provide all pupils with the opportunities to achieve their personal potential.
SEND concerns and procedures
If you have any significant concerns, initially, please contact your child's class teacher who will arrange to meet you and discuss your child and provide advice.
The teacher will record your concerns and inform members of the Inclusion Team.
If your concerns persist and/or the class teacher also has concerns, they will complete a Concerns Form and arrange to meet with you and a member of the Inclusion Team. They may discuss support strategies, signpost to outside agencies and possible interventions to be put in place.
If your child is added to the school SEND register, you will be consulted and have the opportunity to meet with Mrs Milton or Mrs Rogers at the twice yearly Parents' Evenings.
Mrs Issy Rogers co-ordinates all the work with children on the SEND register.
Life skills support
This section provides links to occupational therapy resources that support the development of key life skills, including tying shoelaces and using cutlery. These resources offer practical techniques and step-by-step guidance to help children improve their fine motor skills and independence in everyday tasks. They are designed for parents and caregivers to use with their children at home.
